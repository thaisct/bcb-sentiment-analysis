In July, the Broad National Consumer Price Index (IPCA) rose 0.91%, up from 0.71% in June and 
0.51% in May. The IPCA accumulates a 4.42% change in the first seven months of the year, and a 
6.81% variation in twelve months. The IPCA rise in July can be ascribed to the increase in specific 
regulated prices. Some important components of the IPCA in fact decelerated, as in the case of 
food.  
  
2. 
The General Price Index (IGP-DI) rose 1.14% in July, compared to 1.29% in June, thus 
accumulating an 8.11% change in the first seven months of 2004. The deceleration of the IGP-DI 
in July was due to lower pressures at both the wholesale and the consumer levels. The Wholesale 
Price Index (IPA-DI), which accounts for 60% of the General Index, rose by 1.35%, down from 
1.57% in June. The Consumer Price Index – Brazil (IPC-Br) rose by 0.59%, compared to 0.78% in 
the previous month. Finally, the National Index of Civil Construction (INCC), with a 10% weight in 
the IGP-DI, rose by 1.12%, up from 0.70% in June.   
 
3. 
The main individual contributions to the July IPCA inflation was electricity (0.17 p.p.) and fixed 
telephone tariffs (0.16 p.p.). Auto-fuel contributed with 0.12 p.p., partially reflecting the 10.8% 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2
gasoline price increase to distributors on June 15, as well as the rise in alcohol-based fuel prices. 
Food prices rose 0.67% (0.72% in June), accounting for 0.15 p.p. of the monthly IPCA change. 
The inter-harvest period was responsible for specific pressures on the prices of milk and dairy 
products. Potatoes, sugar, black beans, wheat flour and bread also suffered price increases, while 
soy oil, vegetables, carioca beans and rice prices fell. 
  
4. 
In July, market prices increased 0.52% (0.58% in June), accounting for 0.37 p.p. of the monthly 
IPCA variation, while the increase of 1.89% in regulated prices was responsible for the remaining 
0.54 p.p. The deceleration of market prices inflation was disseminated in both food and non-food 
prices. In fact, 50.3% of the goods and services included in the IPCA basket increased at a lower 
monthly rate in July, compared with 43.2% in June. Regarding regulated prices, besides gasoline, 
alcohol-fuel, electricity and fixed telephone prices, road tolls and urban and interstate buses fares 
also contributed to the rise.    
 
5. 
The IPA-DI deceleration in July reflected lower rises in both agricultural and industrial prices. The 
Agriculture-IPA changed 0.26% in July (0.52% in June). This reduction was a consequence of the 
decrease in prices of cereals and export-oriented crops, as well as lower pressures from the prices 
of animals and by-products, vegetables, fruit and vegetal oils. In the same period, the industry-IPA 
decreased to 1.76% from 1.97%, mainly due to the deceleration of chemical prices (to 2.96% from 
5.37% in June). Other segments that registered lower changes in July, compared to June, include 
mechanical, electrical material, leather, personal care, and tobacco. 
 
6. 
In July, the IPCA core inflation, measured by excluding household food items and regulated prices, 
registered a 0.47% variation (0.53% in June), accumulating 5.02% in the year and 7.27% in 12 
months. The smoothed trimmed-mean core decreased to 0.55% from 0.60% in June, totaling 
4.36% in the year and 8.05% in the last 12 months. Without the smoothing procedure for pre-
selected items, the core recorded 0.59% (0.48% in June), 3.56% in the year and 5.76% in twelve 
months.   
 
7. 
The IPC-Br core, calculated by the Getúlio Vargas Foundation (FGV) under the symmetric 
trimmed-mean method, stood at 0.36% in July (0.50% in June), accumulating 6.21% in the last 
twelve months. 
 
8. 
In August, consumer-prices inflation should fall, mainly due to lower regulated-prices inflation. 
Regarding wholesale inflation, a deceleration is also expected as anticipated by the results of the 
IGP-10 and the first ten-day period of the IGP-M, notwithstanding the continuity of specific 
adjustments due to increases in international commodity prices.  
 
Assessment of Inflation Trends 
  
9. 
The identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to new available information. 
The scenario considered in the simulations assumes the following hypotheses:  
 
a. 
The Copom's projection for the increases of oil and of cooking gas prices in 2004 were 
maintained at 9.5% and 6.8%, respectively; 
 
b. 
The projections for the readjustment of household electricity prices and fixed telephone 
tariffs in 2004 were also unchanged at 11.6% and 12.8%, respectively; 
 
c. 
Regarding all regulated prices, with a total weight of 28.7% in the July IPCA, the Copom 
maintained the projection of an 8.3% average rise for 2004;  
 
d. 
The projection for the readjustment of all regulated prices for 2005, following the model 
of endogenous determination, which takes into account seasonal components, the 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3
exchange rate, market prices inflation and the IGP-DI change, was increased to 6.3% 
from 6.0%;  
 
e. 
The projection for the 6-month spread over the Over-Selic rate, following the 
specification of a Vector Autoregressive model based on the Selic and the swap rates 
on the eve of the Copom meeting, decreases from 88 basis points in the third quarter of 
2004 to 61 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2005.  
 
10. 
Regarding fiscal policy, it is assumed that the consolidated public sector primary surplus target of 
4.25% of the GDP for 2004 and the following two years will be achieved. The related assumptions 
considered in the previous Copom meeting were maintained.  
 
11. 
Considering the benchmark scenario hypotheses, including the maintenance of the Over-Selic rate 
at 16.0% p.a. and of the exchange rate close to the level prevailing on the eve of the Copom 
meeting (R$3.00), the IPCA inflation was projected above the 5.5% target for 2004 and above the 
4.5% target for 2005. According to the market scenario, which takes into consideration the 
consensus Over-Selic rate and the exchange rate as surveyed by the BCB’s Investor Relations 
Group – Gerin on the eve of the Copom meeting, inflation is projected above the targets for both 
2004 and 2005. 
 
Monetary Policy Decision 
 
12. 
In July, the IPCA inflation acceleration was strongly influenced by the 1.89% increase in regulated 
prices. Market prices inflation remained high (0.52%), albeit slightly lower than in June (0.58%).  
Regulated prices have accumulated a 4.69% increase in the first seven months of 2004, compared 
to 4.42% in the IPCA, thus reverting the trend observed up to June, when market prices changes 
systemically surpassed regulated prices variations. As to the wholesale inflation, there has been 
some deceleration since June, both in the agricultural and industrial segments, even though it has 
remained high. The IPA-DI increased 1.35%, accumulating 9.84% in the year. 
 
13. 
The smoothed trimmed-mean core IPCA stood at 0.55% in July. Although this has been the lowest 
rate since February 2004, it is incompatible with the medium-term inflation targets. The non-
smoothed trimmed-mean core posted 0.59%, for the first time since February 2003above the 
smoothed trimmed-mean core. In the first seven months of the year, the smoothed and non-
smoothed trimmed-mean cores registered 4.36% and 3.56%, respectively, equivalent to 
annualized figures of 7.59% and 6.19%. Core inflation excluding household food items and 
regulated prices stood at 0.47% in July, the lowest rate in the year. However, the core by exclusion 
accumulated in the January-July period (5.01%) is well above the headline inflation. 
 
14. 
Economic activity has continued to grow vigorously, as proved by different production, sales and 
employment indicators. According to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics – IBGE, 
industrial output grew 7.7% in the first half of the year, compared to the same period of 2003. In 
monthly terms, industrial production grew 0.5% in June (seasonally adjusted), reaching a new 
historical high, approximately 12% above the recent trough observed in June 2003. Several 
leading and coincident indicators suggest that the industrial rebound gained momentum in July, as 
signaled by the shipments of packaging paper (up 3.4% compared to June, s.a.) and by the 
production of vehicles (up 5.2%, same comparison basis).  
 
15. 
According to the National Industry Confederation – CNI, industrial sales rose by 16.8% in the first 
half of the year, compared to the same period of 2003. In June, industrial sales increased 1.2%, 
s.a., compared to the previous historical high in May. The CNI data have continued to point out a 
higher growth pace for industrial sales than for industrial production. 
 
16. 
According to the IBGE, retail sales have also expanded, not only in nominal terms (up 10.92% in 
the first half of the year, compared to the same period of 2003) but also in volume (up 9.33%). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4
These are the highest growth rates for retail sales since 2001. According to the National 
Association of Autovehicles Manufacturers – Anfavea, domestic car sales increased 3.2% in July, 
month-on-month seasonally adjusted, and 21.4% in the January-July period, compared to the 
same period of 2003.  
 
17. 
The labor market has benefited from the activity rebound. According to the IBGE, the 
unemployment rate fell in June for the second consecutive month, to 11.7%. Data from CNI and 
from the Federation of Industries of São Paulo State – Fiesp confirm a continuous expansion in the 
level of employment and in the real payroll in the manufacturing industry. According to CNI, real 
payroll grew 7.8% in the first half of the year. The level of formal employment, according to the 
Ministry of Labor and Employment, surged 0.5% in June, with more than 1 million jobs created in 
the first half of the year. 
 
18. 
As a natural consequence of what has been occurring in the labor market, the recovery process 
disseminated, reaching not only the credit-sensitive and exports-oriented activities, but also 
activities dependent on labor market conditions. According to the IBGE, sales in supermarkets, 
hypermarkets, food, beverages and tobacco rose by 2.8% in the second quarter (seasonally 
adjusted) and accumulated a 5.4% expansion in the first half of the year, compared to the same 
period of 2003. In the same comparison basis, sales of fabrics, clothing and shoes increased 3.1% 
and 7.3%, respectively. Non-durable goods output has also been reacting to the increase in 
demand and grew 2.1% in the first half of the year, compared to the same period of 2003. In other 
words, different indicators demonstrate that the activity level is now less supported by the 
monetary stimulus that triggered the recovery and more dependent on the labor market, as well as 
on gains in real earnings ensured by the reduction of inflation. 
 
19. 
Meanwhile, the sectors more sensitive to credit conditions, that have led the economic rebound, 
have not yet shown any accommodation in the growth pace. According to the IBGE, furniture and 
appliances sales increased 9.4% in the second quarter (quarter-on-quarter, s.a.), following a 7.2% 
expansion in the first quarter of the year. Cars and autoparts sales rose by 6.3% against –0.3% in 
the same periods. The same trend is noticed for durable consumer goods, whose growth rate 
increased to 7.2% in the second quarter of this year. 
 
20. 
The quarterly FGV industrial survey reported a capacity utilization of 84.1% in July, s.a., close to 
the 85.2% historical peak reached in the first quarter of 1995. The level of idle capacity varied 
heterogeneously among the sectors. From July 2003 to July 2004, capital goods industry 
increased its capacity utilization to 82.0% from 71.6%, approaching its historical peak of 84.7%. 
Consumer goods industry performed similarly, raising its capacity utilization to 83.9% from 76.0%, 
compared to a historical peak of 87.8%. On the other hand, capacity utilization in the intermediate 
goods industry remained flat in the period, in the range between the average and the historical 
peak, an interval much narrower than in other sectors. The heterogeneity is even clearer when the 
data are disaggregated by industrial subsector, with some subsectors close to historical highs and 
some others that have not yet reached their average levels (the series starts in 1990). 
 
21. 
Capital goods absorption (domestic production plus net imports) has continued its expansionary 
trend. Comparing the first half of the year with the same period of 2003, capital goods absorption 
grew 13.8%. The consolidation of this trend is crucial for the economy to broaden its growth 
potential. At this stage, however, it is particularly difficult to project the output gap, in an 
environment of a sharp expansion of demand, as has been observed in the last few quarters. 
 
22. 
Exports, which are still expanding at a fast pace, accumulated a 34% increase in the first half of the 
year, compared to the first half of 2003. In the same period, total imports grew 27% and non-oil 
imports grew 23%, reflecting the strong recovery of domestic demand. The trade balance 
accumulated a US$18.5 billion surplus in the first seven months of the year, while the current 
account registered a US$6.2 billion surplus in the same period. Evidence that the U.S. economy 
may be growing below what was previously expected, with weaker inflationary pressures, lessened 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5
the risk of a faster monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve. As a consequence, market 
volatility has diminished in the last few weeks, what contributed to the maintenance of the Brazilian 
sovereign risk below 600 basis points. The exchange rate oscillated around the July average 
(R$3.04/US$), appreciating to around R$3.00/US$ on the eve of the Copom meeting. 
 
23. 
Oil prices are the main concern in the external front. The recent trend reinforces the fears that oil 
prices may reach and persist for a longer period of time at higher levels than the ones recently 
considered as the most likely scenario, even if some reversion in relation to the recent hikes 
occurs. The Copom's projection for the increase of gasoline prices in 2004 was maintained at 
9.5%, which is enough to eliminate the gap between domestic and international prices, considering 
crude oil at around US$35 per barrel. This benign scenario has been sustained due to the 
diagnosis that part of the recent volatility in oil prices is due to speculative factors that may 
dissipate, even in the presence of some geopolitical risks. However, since the last Copom meeting, 
the balance of risks regarding oil prices increased. These risks may cause a higher-than-expected 
increase in gasoline prices in 2004, or a greater lag between domestic and international prices to 
be corrected in 2005. Moreover, regardless of the evolution of domestic gasoline prices, the 
increase in international oil prices is transmitted to the domestic economy, partly through the 
intermediate productive chains, such as the petrochemical, and also through the deterioration in 
inflation expectations of the private sector.  
 
24. 
The deterioration of market inflation expectations for 2004, initiated in May, has continued since 
the last Copom meeting. The median IPCA expectation increased to 7.18% from 7.10%. The 
median expectation for the next twelve months decreased to 6.22% from 6.27%, and the main 
reason why this happened lies in the fact that the inflation expectation for July 2005 was lower than 
the one for July 2004. The median of inflation expectations for 2005 remained steady at 5.50%, 
albeit the mean and the standard deviation of the surveyed sample increased somewhat, a clear 
evidence of a more pessimistic sentiment of the private sector regarding the 2005 inflation.  
 
25. 
The Copom’s inflation projections, both in the benchmark and in the market scenarios, have 
slightly increased compared to last month. The impact caused by the combination of higher market 
inflation expectations for 2004 and the increase in projected regulated prices in 2005, to 6.3% from 
6.0%, more than offset the effect on the inflation projections caused by the increase in the yield 
curve. The benchmark scenario projections, based on unchanged Over-Selic and exchange rates 
throughout the projection horizon (at 16% p.a. and R$3.00/US$, respectively), point out to an 
inflation rate above the 5.5% target for 2004 and above the 4.5% target for 2005. It should be 
stressed that the projected deviation in relation to the 2005 target is much lower than the one 
projected for 2004. The market scenario, which takes into account the consensus Over-Selic and 
exchange rates on the eve of the Copom meeting, projects inflation rates above the ones of the 
benchmark scenario (i.e., above the targets for 2004 and 2005), since it considers a reduction of 
the Over-Selic rate and a more depreciated exchange rate. The Copom also assessed a third 
hybrid scenario, considering an unchanged Over-Selic rate and the exchange rate path expected 
by the market. Compared to the market scenario, inflation projections were identical for 2004 and 
slightly below for 2005. 
 
26. 
As in previous meetings, the Committee also analyzed the inflation projections for the next 12 
months, corresponding to the second half of 2004 and the first half of 2005. The projected inflation 
for this period, both in the benchmark and market scenarios, stood above the interval between the 
central inflation targets for 2004 and 2005. 
 
27. 
The strong and continuous economic rebound, which already reaches historical highs, requires 
extra caution in the conduct of monetary policy, aimed at preserving the balance between 
aggregate supply and demand. The level of capacity utilization has rapidly increased, approaching 
historical records in some sectors. Recent data for capital goods domestic absorption and for civil 
construction activity indicate that fixed capital investment is recovering. However, during periods of 
reversion in the economic activity cycle, in which fast expansion follow the slow and erratic growth 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6
pattern of the last few years, it is natural to have a high degree of uncertainty regarding the speed 
of growth of the productive capacity in sectors whose current levels of capacity utilization are 
already high, and also regarding the potential growth trend. In this scenario, with the fast increase 
in aggregate demand, it is fundamental to carefully assess the risk of an eventual narrowing of the 
output gap.  
 
28. 
In the previous Copom´s meetings, the Committee´s members stressed that the maintenance of 
the current Over-Selic rate for a long period would consolidate a favorable inflation scenario, with 
the convergence of the actual inflation rate to the inflation targets. However, the monetary authority 
admitted that a more active policy stance could be adopted if inflation projections deviated from the 
targets, due to an eventual deterioration of the underlying factors that led to the increase in inflation 
projections. The Committee´s members understand that since the last meeting two factors 
enhanced the risks that could jeopardize the accomplishment of the inflation targets. The first one 
is the increase in oil prices. The possibility of a higher and longer rise in oil prices than previously 
projected, not accompanied by an adjustment of the monetary policy, could produce second-order 
effects incompatible with the inflation-targeting regime. The second factor, partially a consequence 
of the increase in oil prices, is the deterioration of inflation expectations for 2005, which had been 
steady for some time. As the scenario is not consolidated yet, the Copom will be cautious to the 
new developments of these factors.  
 
29. 
Even if the inflationary scenario should require an adjustment of the Over-Selic rate in the future, it 
is important to reiterate that it should not impact the sustainable growth process of the Brazilian 
economy. On the contrary, monetary policy contributes to growth by fighting second-order effects 
of the supply shocks, and by promoting the balance between the expansion of aggregate demand 
and the broadening of the economy’s productive capacity. Moreover, sustaining inflation in a path 
consistent with the inflation targets is essential to preserve real earnings, fundamental for the 
continuous and balanced expansion of the domestic demand, and for the dissemination of the 
economic growth benefits to the population.  
 
30. 
Considering the reasons stated above, the Committee decided, unanimously, to maintain the target 
for the Over-Selic rate at 16.0% p.a., without bias. 
 
31. 
At the closing of the meeting, it was announced that the Copom would meet again on September 
14, for technical presentations, and on the following day to discuss the monetary policy decision, 
as established in Communiqué 11,516, of October 15, 2003.

SUMMARY OF DATA ANALYZED BY THE COPOM 
 
Economic Activity 
 
32. 
According to IBGE’s retail survey, sales expanded for the sixth consecutive month in June, 
increasing by 0.17% month-on-month, seasonally adjusted. Compared to June 2003, real sales 
and nominal revenues increased 12.8% and 15.6%, respectively. The regional distribution of 
growth was generalized, encompassing all States in the country, except Roraima. All groups 
encompassing the retail sector posted year-on-year growth rates in June, with highlights to 
furniture and electrical appliances, which increased 36.3%. 
 
33. 
The São Paulo Trade Association (ACSP) data for July registered a 1.2% increase in credit retail 
sales, while the Usecheque system consultations rose 3.4%, both compared to June, seasonally 
adjusted. In the year up to July, the same indicators rose by 7.0% and 1.8%, respectively. 
 
34. 
The Federation of Commerce of São Paulo (Fecomercio) consumer sentiment survey showed that 
the Consumer Confidence Index (ICC) increased 2.2% in August, standing at 121.3 points (range 0 
to 200). This increase was due to improved future expectations by consumers.  
 
35. 
Regarding fixed capital investment, capital goods output and construction inputs continued to grow 
in June, accumulating year-on-year expansions of 25.2% and of 3.4%, respectively. Capital goods 
imports increased 8.9% in the same comparison basis. The domestic capital goods absorption 
rose by 13.8%, despite the 52.3% increase of exports, mainly agriculture machinery. The National 
Bank for Economic and Social Development (BNDES) credit operations increased 47.7% in the 
first half of the year, compared to the same period of 2003. Credit operations to industry (about 
41% of total credit outstanding) expanded by 27.7%. Credit to commerce and the services sector 
increased by 52.8%, and credit to the agriculture sector grew 101.3%. 
 
36. 
The IBGE’s monthly industrial survey registered a 0.5% increase in industrial output in June, 
compared to May (seasonally adjusted). The manufacturing industry expanded 0.4%, while mining 
activity increased 1.8%. Out of the 23 activities surveyed, 13 registered increases in output, while 
out of the 4 categories, 3 expanded. Intermediate goods output decreased 0.4%, after five 
consecutive months of increase. In the year up to June, industrial output increased 7.7%, 
compared to the same period of 2003, with output expansion in 22 out of the 26 activities and in all 
use categories, with highlights to export-oriented and agribusiness activities, as well as credit-
sensitive activities. Semi and non-durable goods production increased 2.1%, reflecting the gradual 
recovery of the labor market. 
 
37. 
In June, the CNI recorded a 1.2% increase in real industrial sales and a 0.9% increase in industrial 
worked hours, in comparison to May, seasonally adjusted. Compared to the same month in 2003, 
real sales and worked hours increased 27.7% and 8.2%, respectively. The level of average 
capacity utilization in industry reached 83.2%, the highest ever, with a 1.7% monthly increase 
(seasonally adjusted). In the first half of the year, capacity utilization expanded 2.1%, compared to 
the same period of 2003. 
 
38. 
According to the FGV industrial survey nationwide, the average level of capacity utilization stood at 
84.1% in July, s.a. This level is the highest since 2000 and is approximately 4 p.p. above the 1990-
2004 historical average, albeit still below the record high of 85.2% registered in April 1995. The 
mechanic industry is in the historical high, while other six industries are close to the historical 
peaks. Transportation material and pharmaceutical products are the only two industries that remain 
below the respective historical average.     
 
39. 
The FGV survey and the CNI business sentiment survey pointed out improved confidence in July. 
These surveys also perceived a better prospect in terms of domestic demand.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
8
40. 
In July, leading indicators anticipate a continued expansion in industrial output. Packaging paper 
shipments expanded 3.8% in the month, s.a., accumulating a 13.0% growth in the year. The car 
industry produced 189 thousand vehicles, up 5.2% compared to June (seasonally adjusted), and 
38.8% above July 2003. In the year to July, car production increased 18.0%, while domestic sales 
and exports expanded 21.5% and 12.5%, respectively, compared to the same period of last year. 
 
Labor Market 
 
41. 
The formal employment increased 0.5% in June, compared to May, s.a., and 4.8% compared to 
June 2003, according to the Ministry of Labor and Employment. In the first half of 2004, there was 
a 3.9% expansion in formal employment compared to the same period of last year. This result 
corresponded to 1,034,656 new employed workers in the first half of the year, compared to 
560,907 in the first half of 2003. 
 
42. 
The unemployment rate, measured by the IBGE in the six main metropolitan regions of the 
country, decreased in June for the second consecutive month, standing at 11.7% after peaking to 
13.1% last April. Total employed workers increased 0.4% in June, while unemployed workers fell 
4.1%.    
  
43. 
In industry, seasonally adjusted CNI data showed expansions of 0.7% in employed workers and 
1% in real payroll in June, compared to May. In the first half of the year, real payroll and employed 
workers increased 7.8% and 1.2%, respectively, compared to the same period of 2003. 
  
Credit and Delinquency Rates 
  
44. 
Non-earmarked credit operations increased 1.2% in July. Individual credit operations increased 
1.8%, while corporate credit expanded 0.8%, led by the increase of 1.3% in credit with domestic 
funding. Corporate credit with external funding fell 0.2%.  
  
45. 
The average interest rate on non-earmarked credit decreased 0.1 p.p. in July, standing at 43.9% 
p.a. Corporate interest rates remained stable at 29.7% p.a., while the average rate for individuals 
decreased 0.4 p.p. to 62% p.a. Total delinquency in non-earmarked credit maintained the 
downward trend in July, falling to 7.1% from 7.2% in June, specially due to the 0.3 p.p. fall in 
individual default rate.  
  
46. 
The default rate measured by the ACSP fell in July to the lowest level of the year. The total number 
of cancelled and new files increased 10.4% and 6.5%, respectively, in the year to July. The 
number of returned checks, compared to the total number of checks, decreased to 5.1% in June, 
also reaching the lowest level of the year.  
  
External Environment 
 
47. 
Recent indicators suggested some deceleration of the world economy growth, partially attributed to 
oil prices increases. The second quarter U.S. GDP stood at 3.0% in annual terms, below expected. 
The Japanese GDP grew 0.4% in the second quarter, also below expectations, while the Euro 
Zone economy grew 0.5%, below the 0.6% rate recorded in the first quarter of the year.  
  
48. 
The slower U.S. GDP growth in the second quarter of the year was led by the reduction in 
consumption growth, which increased 1.0% in the second quarter, compared to 4.1% in the first 
quarter. In China, industrial production increased 15.5% in July, year-on-year, the lowest rate in the 
last twelve months. On the other had, the Economic Commission for Latin America and the 
Caribbean (ECLAC) revised the growth forecast for the region in 2004 to 4.5% from 4.0% 
estimated in May.

49. 
Regarding monetary policy, the Bank of England raised its repo rate by 25 b.p., to 4.75%, while the 
European Central Bank decided to maintain its basic interest rate unchanged at 2.0%, regardless 
of the increase in oil prices. In the U.S., the Federal Reserve decided to raise the target for the fed 
funds rate by 25 b.p., considering that the weaker activity level in June and July was transitory, 
owing primordially to the rise in energy prices, and that the economy was prepared to resume a 
stronger pace of expansion in the near future.

The continuous increases in oil prices posed risks to global economic growth and price stability, as 
well as limited the recovery of asset prices. The interaction between geopolitical factors (tensions 
in the Middle East, uncertainties about the future of Yukos and the referendum in Venezuela), 
growing demand and constrained supply contributed to increase oil prices, reaching record levels 
in August.  
 
Foreign Trade and Balance of Payments 
 
51. 
The Brazilian trade balance posted a US$3.5 billion surplus in July. Exports and imports increased 
54.0% and 42.3%, respectively, compared to July 2003 daily averages. Total external trade 
reached US$14.5 billion in July, accumulating a historical high for a 12-month-period (US$141.7 
billion). In the first two weeks of August (10 working days), the trade balance surplus totaled 
US$1.7 billion, with increases of 34.9% for exports and of 34.7% for imports, year-on-year.  
 
52. 
In July, Brazilian exports totaled US$9.0 billion, registering historical records for manufactured and 
semi-manufactured goods. Manufactured exports reached US$4.7 billion, while primary exports 
totaled US$2.8 billion and semi-manufactured exports amounted to US$1.3 billion, with increases 
of 47.3%, 71.5%, and 43.7%, respectively, compared to the same period of 2003. 
 
53. 
Imports totaled US$5.5 billion, maintaining the upward trend initiated at the end of 2003. All 
categories grew, led by fuel (up 121.5%), consumer goods (+38.3%), raw material and 
intermediate goods (+34.6%) and capital goods (+23.8%). 
 
54. 
In July, the current account registered a US$1.9 billion surplus, accumulating a US$6.2 billion 
surplus in the year. In the first seven months of the year, the trade balance and current transfers 
posted US$18.5 billion and US$1.9 billion surpluses, respectively, while the services and income 
account posted a US$14.1 billion deficit. Net foreign direct investment reached US$1.5 billion in 
July, accumulating US$5.5 billion in the first seven months of the year. At the end of July, 
international reserves stood at US$49.7 billion, while adjusted net reserves stood at US$23.0 
billion (IMF concept).  
 
Money Market and Open Market Operations 
 
55. 
After the July Copom’s meeting, the domestic yield curve moved upwards, mainly in its longer end. 
The determinant factor justifying the yield curve move was the market’s interpretation about the 
July Copom’s minutes, but international markets volatility and some internal political noises also 
contributed for the move. From July 21 to August 18, the spread on the 3-month and 6-month rates 
in relation to the Over-Selic rate increased 0.13 p.p. and 0.38 p.p., respectively, while the 1-year 
and the 2-year rates increased 0.56 p.p. and 0.47 p.p. In the same period, the real interest rate 
measured by the ratio between the one-year nominal interest rate and the 12-month-ahead 
inflation expectations increased to 10.6% from 10.1%.  
 
56. 
In the period between the last Copom meetings, the BCB carried out an auction to rollover 
securities and Fx swaps coming due on August 12. In this auction, US$281 million in swaps were 
contracted (18% of the principal coming due), with tenures of 11 and 17 months. The net 
redemption of Fx-linked securities and swaps in the year to August totals US$23.4 billion.

The National Treasury carried out four offerings of LTNs, totaling R$5.5 billion. Four LFTs auctions 
were also carried out (three selling and one buying, the latter simultaneously to the second selling 
auction), placing net R$3 billion maturing in 2005, 2006 and 2007. In the same period, there were 
one buying auction and one selling auction for National Treasury Notes – Series B and C (NTN-Bs 
and NTN-Cs), which amounted R$737 million in net sales. 
 
58. 
The BCB maintained in its open market operations the weekly post-fixed repo operations (2-week 
tenure) and the fixed repo operations (3-month tenure), as well as its daily liquidity management 
operations. The BCB also carried out in this period 16 fixed rate overnight repos. The higher 
frequency of these operations after July 28 enabled the reduction of the gap between the Over-
Selic rate and its target, from 0.25 p.p. on July 27 to 0.13 p.p. on August 18. In the period after the 
July Copom’s meeting, the excess liquidity drained from the market with operations shorter than 30 
days fell to R$34.5 billion on average, while with the 3-month-tenure operations, it rose to R$46.9 
billion on average. 
 
59. 
In July, the net securitized domestic public debt was stable. The fixed share decreased to 15.1% 
from 16.8% in June, due to the net redemption in the month. The dollar-linked share also 
decreased, to 14.1% from 15.8% in June.
