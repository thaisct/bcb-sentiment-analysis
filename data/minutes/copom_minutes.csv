04/02/2000;43;Arminio Fraga;"Signs of expansion in aggregate demand began to appear toward the end of 1999. Growth occurred under industrial sales and check and credit card transactions and was accompanied by a moderate increase under banking credit, all in a framework of declining default levels.
In November, the supermarket segment and wholesale trade sector turned in nominal growth of 16.4% and 20.9%, respectively, when compared to the same month of the preceding year. In the retail sector, real revenues in five metropolitan regions accumulated a 4.41% drop in the year up to November. However, when one excludes factory authorized vehicle sales outlets from this calculation, the final result was very close to stability (0.23%).
In December, automotive sales expanded by 2.9%, with growth of 10.2% under exports and a 1% decline under internal market sales. Marketing of farm machines increased by 12.2%, with positive growth under both exports (28.6%) and internal market sales (7.8%).
With exception of the São Paulo retail trade sector, the first signs of credit growth became evident and were paralleled by a generalized drop in default levels. Based on expanded credit operations with the trade (4.2%) and rural sectors (2.6%), normally performing loans extended to the private sector by the financial system increased by 0.8% in November. Defaults in the private financial system have followed a downward trajectory since May 1999. In the public financial system, the default level moved into a downward curve in the September-November quarter. In the month of December, credit card transactions increased by 30.6% and the volume of checks cleared expanded by 1.9%. A comparison with December 1998 shows growth figures of 20% and –5.3% in the same order, indicating considerably less intense utilization of checks as a payment instrument.
In the month of January, the consumer confidence index (ICC), which is released by the Trade Federation of the State of São Paulo (FCESP), turned upward. The highlights of this index were the items expectations, with an increase from 120.8 to 128.7, and current economic conditions, with growth from 65.4 to 72.7.
In accumulated terms for the year up to November, investment indicators registered negative growth rates. Output of capital goods and building industry inputs dropped by 10.2% and 3.9% in the year, with a less intense decline in the final six months. The rate of gross fixed capital formation in the third quarter of the year came to 17.9% of GDP at current prices, as against 18.1% of GDP in the previous quarter.
In the month of November, the consolidated public sector primary surplus came to R$ 758 million, raising the accumulated total in the year to R$ 32.8 billion, compared to the target of R$ 27.8 billion specified in the agreement with the IMF. When one excludes the impact of alterations in the rate of exchange on the internal debt indexed to exchange, the nominal public sector deficit closed at R$ 3.1 billion.
In 1999, export and import operations declined by 6.1% and 14.8% in relation to the previous year. The trade balance registered a deficit of US$ 1.2 billion in the year, as against US$ 6.6 billion in 1998. One should stress, however, that export volumes have increased since July while foreign market prices have shown signs of recovery since August. In the case of imports, the volume index registered moderate growth in October and November, while average prices have risen sharply since the second quarter of the year, mostly as a consequence of oil price hikes. In 1999, the service account accumulated a deficit of US$ 25 billion, as against US$ 28.8 billion in the preceding year. The 27.7% increase in interest payments was more than offset by a 42.3% reduction under net outlays on other headings, particularly international travel, profits and dividends and transportation. The 1999 current account deficit of US$ 24.4 billion was easily financed by an inflow of US$ 30 billion in direct foreign investments (23% greater than the deficit).
Supply indicators suggest a moderate degree of recovery toward the end of 1999. In the seasonally adjusted series, November industrial output remained stable, with growth of just –0.1%, while expansion in December is estimated at 2.4%. A breakdown of November industrial output by category of utilization shows that production of capital goods increased by 1.2% and output of intermediate goods expanded by 0.7%. Reflecting stability in the output of consumer durables and a 1.8% reduction in semidurable and nondurable consumer goods, the heading of consumer goods in general closed with a decline of 2%.
Labor market indicators now point to a gradual decline in the jobless rate. In 1999, average unemployment closed at 7.56% as compared to 7.60% in the previous year. In the month of December, unemployment dropped to 6.28% following 7.32% in November, reflecting growth of 0.84% in the number of jobholders and a reduction of 0.29% in the economically active population.
In the United States, indicators point to a high level of aggregate demand with potential imbalances in relation to the pace of growth in supply. However, it should be noted that price indices have not revealed any significant sources of consistent pressures. Retail sector sales increased by 1.2% in December and closed with 9.7% expansion in the year, with record vehicle sales of 16.8 million units in 1999. In the series purged of seasonal factors, consumer credit operations expanded by 4.6% in October and 13.7% in November. Real estate construction rose by 0.12% in October. The October balance of trade (goods) closed with a negative US$ 33.7 billion and an accumulated deficit of US$ 283.5 billion in the year.
The growth trajectory under output remained strong. Based on seasonally adjusted data, GDP expanded by an annualized rate of 5.7% in the third quarter (revised) in relation to the previous quarter. Industrial production expanded by 0.4% in December, closing with accumulated growth of 5% in 1999. Average hourly wages increased by 0.15% in November, in comparison to the previous month and 3.9% when compared to November 1998. The rate of unemployment has remained stable at 4.1% since October.
Price trends continue favorable. The consumer price index (CPI) increased by 0.2% in December, with accumulated growth of 2.7% in the year. The CPI core increased by 0.1% and 1.9%, in the same periods. The producer price index (PPI) and its core increased by 0.1% in December, accumulating respective growth rates of 3% and 0.9% in 1999. A breakdown of the PPI pointed to expansion of 15.8% under raw materials and 3.9% under intermediate goods.
In Japan, growth in aggregate demand is still highly tenuous and reflects moderate growth in private consumption, downward movement in public and private investments and foreign sales that were impacted negatively by valuation of the yen. The trade surplus dropped to US$ 6.3 billion in November, reflecting growth in import demand and valuation of exchange. On the supply side, the situation can be summarized in low stock levels and high levels of utilization of installed production capacity. The rate of unemployment continued on a downward curve and closed November at 4.5%, when compared to 4.9% in July. Real wages have registered positive growth in recent months.
In the Euro Zone, the economy has begun expanding at a more consistent pace and this has been reflected in both product and industrial output. In the third quarter of the year, GDP expanded by a seasonally adjusted rate of 4.2% in annualized terms, in relation to the previous quarter. Unemployment has moved steadily downward and closed November at 9.8%. The monetary aggregate M3 increased by 6.2% in November in comparison to the same month of 1998. The harmonized IPC expanded by
1.5% in twelve months up to November, as compared to 1.4% up to October.
Based on data from which seasonal factors have been removed, GDP in England expanded by 3.1% in the third quarter in annualized terms, when compared to the preceding quarter. In the face of doubts regarding the possibility of sustaining the rate of growth, the Bank of England introduced a preventive increase in basic interest rates of 25 base points to a level of 5.75% in January 2000. 
Industrial output in Argentina increased by 1.5% in November, registering the fourth consecutive month of positive growth. However, in accumulated terms for the year, the final result was a decline of 8.3%. The 1999 fiscal deficit came to US$ 6.9 billion or considerably more than the US$ 5.9 billion level predicted by the government. At the provincial level, the deficit came to US$ 3.7 billion, as against an expected negative result of US$ 1.7 billion.
In 1999, the broad consumer price index (IPCA) expanded by 8.9%. This result was consistent with the annual inflation targeting system that has been used as the basic monetary policy guideline since the month of June. The target defined for 1999 was annual IPCA growth of 8%, with upward or downward deviations of up to two percentage points.
In December, the pace of price increases slowed. Wholesale price indices reflected drops in farm and industrial prices, while consumer price indices showed that the impact of earlier alcohol and gasoline price increases had been fully absorbed. In December, IPCA expanded by 0.6%, as compared to 0.95% in the previous month.
In 1999, the general price index – internal supply (IGP-DI) and general price index – market (IGPM) increased by 19.98% and 20.10%, respectively. However, the strongest growth occurred under the wholesale price index – internal supply (IPA-DI), with 28.9% in the year. The consumer price index – Fipe (IPC-Fipe) accumulated growth of 8.6% in the period.
According to a Banco Central survey, the expectations of analysts with regard to the major price indices in the first quarter of 2000 point to lower inflation, particularly in general price indices.
Any evaluation of the inflationary outlook should begin with identification of shocks capable of impacting the future price level trajectory. The potential shocks cited in both the December Inflation Report andat the previous Copom meeting remain essentially valid. The basic scenario considers an increase in federal fund rates that has already been absorbed by futures markets , an average 9.2% increase in prices set by the public sector in 2000 , farm sector neutrality with respect to price pressures during the year, already taking due account of the seasonal increase in agricultural products in the first half of the year , and fiscal policy compliance with the R$ 36.7 billion target for the consolidated public sector accumulated primary surplus in 2000, with highly positive influence in terms of price stability.
In relation to the macroeconomic environment considered in the December Inflation Report, the major difference is elimination of the doubts that had generated considerable wariness within highly computerized sectors of the economy as regards transition to the new century. With respect to the rate of exchange, the process of valuation of the nation’s currency that began in December was confirmed in average terms in the first half of January. This process has been further strengthened by sharp declines registered in the value of the risk premium on Brazilian sovereign debt papers since the fourth quarter of 1999.
Based on alternative scenarios that deviate slightly from the core scenario, economic models were subjected to a series of simulations. These simulations lead to the conclusion that maintenance of interest at current levels will, with a high degree of probability, make it possible to comply with inflation targets in 2000 and 2001.
Short-term forecasts as well as antecedent inflation indicators were presented. Analysis of these results leads to the conclusion that inflation will tend downward in the early months of 2000. In more specific terms, antecedent indicators suggest a more abrupt drop in inflation in the month of February. It should be noted that January results still tend to reflect the supply problems that occurred under fruit and vegetables as a result of prolonged rain in the southeast region. At the same time, they also incorporate the seasonal factors characteristic of the start of the school year.
According to the daily survey carried out by Banco Central, expectations of inflation according to the IPCA, measured on January 18, indicated a median rate higher than the target for 2000 (6.94% as against a target of 6%).
On December 15, 1999, Copom not only maintained the Selic rate target unaltered at 19% per year but also resolved, once again, not to indicate a bias. This decision was in keeping with the expectations of practically all the participating market institutions consulted.
Between December 16, 1999 and January 18, 2000, the National Treasury carried out three LTN sales auctions, one LTN purchase auction and two LFT sales auctions. No alterations were introduced into the programming of market security placements previously announced by the National Treasury.
Definitive operations with Banco Central papers were, once again, restricted to sales of two year NBCE. The three NBCE auctions were carried out at uniform prices and had the objective of rolling the maturing debt since they resulted in net placements of just R$ 49 million. One should note that, since December 28, 1999, the NBCE coupon has been defined in each issue notification.
Continuing its efforts to construct a more dynamic federal securities secondary market, Banco Central intervened in the money market on ten different occasions for a total of 24 business days. The objective was to manage the financing cost of these papers in situations marked by imbalances in banking reserves.
Analyzing the January 17 position of interest rate forward operations, one notes a shift into a downward curve. At the same time, one perceives that the interest curve is practically horizontal, with one year swap operations generating 20.65% per year as compared to the Selic rate target of 19% per year.
Analysis of supply and demand reveals an absence of imbalances capable of generating inflationary pressures for the inflation targeting system in the foreseeable future. Consumption and credit indicators point to a process of still tenuous recovery with an outlook for considerable improvement during the course of 2000. However, they do not stand as risks to supply and demand equilibrium and, consequently, are not considered sources of inflationary pressures. Fiscal policy will remain austere and will contribute positively to price stability. Since December, the foreign sector – and, more precisely, the trade balance – has performed well and one can expect strong improvement in export operations. Having overcome the sense of wariness that dominated highly computerized systems during the transition to the new century, the early days of 2000 were marked by strong capital inflows and improvement in foreign financing conditions. Monitoring of the farm harvest reveals no significant price pressures during the year.
The overall scenario is more conducive to price stability than in the period prior to the previous meeting of the Committee. Monetary policy decisions are taken on the basis of evaluation of a series of factors that, one way or another, introduce risks in terms of the future evolution of inflation, including: 1) growth in public sector prices and tariffs during the course of the year, with potential for exerting pressure on the inflation trajectory independently of supply and demand conditions , 2) a trend to gradually more restrictive monetary policies in the United States, England and Euro Zone during the year , and 3) the behavior of international oil prices which, at the moment, are being pressured by the harsh winter season in the United States.
The decline in inflation measured by the IPCA from November to December points to convergence to a trend that is more compatible with inflation targets. However, the first figures for January inflation, particularly as measured by the consumer price index (IPC) of the general price index – market (IGPM), suggest a rather modest drop in relation to December 1999. However, it should be noted that several seasonal factors – such as those consequent upon the start of the school year and fruit and vegetable supply problems caused by heavy rain in the southeast region – have impacted this performance.

12/09/2000;50;Arminio Fraga;"Following second quarter deceleration, demand indicators turned upward once again at the start of the third quarter, particularly under consumption and industrial sales. Among the factors that contributed to this turnaround, one should cite more plentiful credit and lower interest rates on bank credits, coupled with rising exports and private investment.
The balance of credit operations at preset rates involving nonearmarked resources increased by 1.5% in July. Credits to individuals rose by 1.3% in the month, registering accumulated expansion of 62.3% in the year and 91.5% over 12 months. Personal credit and financing for acquisition of goods were the segments that turned in the strongest growth. Business credits increased by 1.7% in the month, 4.8% in the year and 23.3% in 12 months.
Real revenues in the retail trade sector of the metropolitan region of São Paulo rose by 11.2% in the year up to July, according to figures released by the Trade Federation of the State of São Paulo. Growth was particularly strong under sales involving goods with high unit value as a result of a more ample supply of credit. Revenues on sales of durable consumer goods increased by 17.2%, while sales of the automotive industry registered a high of 11.6% in comparison to the same period of the previous year. Particular mention should be made of the performance of the supermarket segment in the last two months, as sales of nondurable consumer goods climbed by 13.7% in the same period of time.
The number of consultations with the Trade Association of São Paulo (ACSP) up to the month of July indicates more accentuated growth in installment sales when compared to the use of checks (10.3% and 6.1%, respectively). This movement corroborates the improvement that has occurred in consumer credit conditions, making it much easier to purchase goods over longer terms and at lesser interest rates. Parallel to this, the number of transactions effected through the use of credit cards up to July expanded by a full 23.9%.
Another factor that has contributed to a greater credit supply is the decline in the net rate of defaults. According to the ACSP, the default level in São Paulo came to 5.8% in July. This was the lowest level in the last 11 months and was caused by both a decrease in current defaults registered and an increase in cancellations of past defaults. Up to the month of July, the automobile industry registered expansion of 21.9% in sales, with growth of 49.6% under exports and 15.7% under internal sales. Foreign sales of farm machines increased by 39.7% in the same period. Exports of motorcycles grew by 95.7% up to July, while overall sales expanded by 32.6% in the period.
Investment indicators registered growth throughout the first half of the year. According to IPEA estimates, the investment rate came to 19.3% in June, reflecting steady upward movement from a low of 18.2% in June 1999. Output of capital goods increased by 8.5%, while the volume of imports dropped by 13.6% in the same period, clearly revealing the impact that the exchange policy shift has had on the import substitution process.
The balance of trade turned in a surplus of US$ 937 million up to July, as compared to a deficit of US$ 531 million in the same period of 1999. It is important to note that this turnaround was achieved despite growth in international oil prices, a factor that partially explains the increase that has occurred under imports. In this period, foreign sales increased by 17.3% in relation to the same period of the previous year, with a particularly strong performance under sales of manufactured goods (22.9%).
The manufactured goods that registered the sharpest sales growth were transmission/reception equipment, aircraft and passenger cars, with respective revenue increases of 169.1%, 78.1% and 70.3%. Foreign sales of semimanufactured products rose by 9.9% while exports of basic goods grew by 6%. Iron ore continued as the most important export product, accumulating US$ 1.758 billion in the period, with growth of 11.3%.
Up to the month of July, imports rose by 11.5% due mostly to greater outlays on fuels and lubricants (49.9%) caused by higher international petroleum prices. Imports of raw materials and intermediate goods expanded by 21.8%, reflecting the upturn in industrial output growth and expanded exports of manufactured products. One should stress that the manufactured goods exported by Brazil contain high levels of imported components.
In the first half of 2000, GDP expanded by 3.8% in relation to the same period of 1999. The best performance was registered by the industrial sector, with growth of 6.8%. Crop and livestock output increased by 6.5% while the service sector turned in expansion of 3%, with a strong 14.1% performance under communications. 
Output of consumer durables registered growth of 22.1% in the first six months of the year, in relation to the same 1999 period, and was the leader among the various industrial segments. In order of magnitude, this performance was followed by output of intermediate goods and capital goods with respective growth rates of 7.9% and 8.5%. On the other hand, production of semidurable and nondurable goods declined by 0.8% in the same period. One should note that the level of industrial production at the end of the first half of the year was the highest since the IBGE began recording this series in 1975
However, when distributed into use categories, the only sector to register successive records was output of intermediate goods. At the end of June, the output levels of durable goods, capital and semi and nondurable goods were still well below the most recent peak in this series. According to the FGV survey, the average level of utilization of installed output capacity came to 82.8% in July, indicating that the economy still has a considerable amount of idle production capacity.
The grain harvest is expected to expand by 4.3% in the 1999/2000 agricultural year, according to IBGE estimates elaborated in June. Frosts in the month of July are expected to generate adverse impacts on the output of such winter crops as wheat and the intermediate corn harvest. Despite this, however, this year’s harvest should still be slightly greater than that of last year.
With regard to the labor market, figures for the first half of the year indicate that the process of employment and productivity growth begun toward the end of 1999 has moved steadily forward. In the month of June, formal employment registered positive growth (+0.7%) for the eighth consecutive month. Increased employment was registered in all sectors of the economy, with the sole exception of construction. The result was creation of 590 thousand jobs in the first half of the year. The rate of open unemployment declined to 7.41% in June, with sharp growth in the overall economically active population.
Recent indicators further strengthen the signs that the United States economic performance has begun leveling off. Notwithstanding the high level of activity, inflation has remained stable, mostly as a result of productivity gains. 
The second quarter GDP increased by 6% in annualized terms, when compared to the same 1999 period. Industrial production expanded by 0.3% in July, raising growth to 4.9% in 12 months. In June, the trade deficit came to US$ 37.2 billion, raising the accumulated total to US$ 404.8 billion in the last 12 months. In the month of July, the rate of unemployment held steady at 4%. Productivity in the manufacturing sector increased by 6.9% in the second quarter, while the unit cost of labor dropped by 1.9%.
The producer price index (PPI) held steady in July and accumulated 4.1% growth in 12 months, while the core index registered rates of 0.1% and 1.5%, respectively. The consumer price index (CPI) and the CPI-core rose by 0.2% in July, raising accumulated 12 month expansion by 3.6% and 2.4%, in the same order. These figures indicate that inflation is firmly under control.
In Japan, industrial output moved upward in the first six months of the year, with accumulated 12 month growth of 4.7%. In June, housing starts rose by 12.6% and factory orders increased by 14.3%. One should note that, in the last 12 months, growth in family spending declined from 1.9% in May to 1.8% in June. In the first six months of the year, the trade surplus expanded by 7.8%, while imports expanded at a still more intense pace. Unemployment rose from 4.6% in May to 4.7% in June. For the first time in a decade, the Bank of Japan increased its basic interest rate, moving to 0.25% per year, marking the end of a period of 17 months with a nominal rate equal to zero.
In the Euro Zone countries, annual industrial production growth picked up steam in May, registering growth of 7.2%, as compared to 5.8% in April. Quarterly growth in productivity increased by 2% in the first quarter of the year, the highest level since the first quarter of 1998. Unemployment turned downward once again in June and closed at 9.1%. The harmonized consumer price index increased by 0.2% in July, as growth over the last 12 months remained steady at 2.4%. In the first five months of the year, foreign sales expanded by 2.6% and imports rose by 11.2% when compared to the same 1999 period. Consequently, the accumulated 12 month surplus dropped to US$ 37.5 billion, the lowest since the euro was first adopted.
In Argentina, industrial production rose by 3.1% in July, with accumulated 12 month expansion of 4%. The rate of unemployment increased to 15.4% in May, as compared to 13.8% in October and 14.5% in May 1999. In the first half of the year, the trade surplus totaled US$ 896 million, due mostly to 13% growth in exports, with a particularly strong performance under petroleum and soybeans. Imports increased by 2% in the same period, despite a decline in the volume index. The overall fiscal deficit accumulated in the first six months of the year came to $ 2.24 billion (excluding privatizations) and easily complied with the $ 2.69 billion target negotiated with the IMF for the period in question. In July, the Treasury’s financial result was a negative $ 1 billion. The differential between interest rates on peso and dollar deposits on the 30 day interbank market has remained practically stable at 0.5% per year since mid-June, following the decline that occurred in response to the government’s announcement of public spending cuts in the second quarter of the year. 
International oil market price moved upward once again at the end of July, reflecting worries generated by insufficient United States stocks, particularly in the case of such derivatives as gasoline.
In the month of July, both general price indices and consumer price indices registered the highest growth rates of the year. This result was due to the fact that the impact of three factors was concentrated in a single month: supply pressures caused by the off-season period, contractual price increases for electricity and telephone services and higher fuel prices.
In July, the general price index – domestic supply (IGP-DI) increased by 2.26%, due to expansion of 2.79% under wholesale prices, 1.91% under consumer prices and 0.30% in construction costs. Taken as a whole, farm products accounted for 1.06 percentage points of the change in the wholesale price index (IPA) and 0.53 in the consumer price index (IPC), accounting for practically 35% of the growth in the general price index (IGP). The products responsible for this high were few and included beef, milk, beans. Adjustments in the prices of petroleum derivatives and alcohol accounted for 43% of the rise in the general index.
Adjustments in government managed prices were responsible for 62% of the monthly change in the broad consumer price index (IPCA). Of this total, 34% of the impact resulted from the rise in petroleum and alcohol prices and 28% from growth in the rates charged for telephone and electricity services and airline tickets. The impact of the agricultural off-season was aggravated by adverse climatic factors and accounted for 25% of the change. When these three factors are brought together, they accounted for 87% of the 1.61% growth registered by the IPCA in July.
Though these increases were no surprise to the market, their magnitude was unexpected and led the institutions included in the survey carried out by Banco Central to revise their projections upward for the year as a whole. Median expectations for IPCA growth in the year shifted from 6.0% to 6.1%.
In order to evaluate the inflation outlook for the year, one must first identify the shocks capable of generating impacts on future price level trends. These shocks and their impacts were reassessed in light of new information. In summarized form, the major points taken into consideration were as follows:
a. Inflation in the month of July was sharply higher than expected due to two factors. In the first place, with the drought in major meat and milk production areas, the effects of the off-season period were felt earlier than usual. Secondly, the failure of the sugarcane harvest in the southeast region generated a strong increase in sugar and alcohol prices, with indirect impacts on gasoline prices.
b. This unexpected performance had the natural impact of shifting the start of the future inflation trajectory upward. Parallel to this, since fuel increases occurred in the second half of July, part of the impact will still be felt in terms of August inflation.
c. International oil prices moved back to the range of US$ 30 and, based on the prices used in futures contracts, there are no expectations of declines in coming months.
d. Despite lesser probability of changes in fed fund interest rates up to the end of the year, the hypothesis of a small increase in the fourth quarter, which is implicit in futures contracts, was maintained.
e. Data on the evolution of GDP in the second quarter of the year are fully in line with previous estimates, as evident in the fact that inflationary pressures caused by aggregate demand over the coming months were not detected.
f. The conservative estimate of an increase in food prices was revised from just over 2% to 3% in the final quarter of 2000. This rate is higher than inflation projected for the IPCA in the period. 
The other hypotheses discussed at the previous meeting were maintained, particularly that regarding a primary surplus fully in keeping with the targets defined by fiscal policy. 
Based on simulations performed with the basic scenario, it was concluded that, if the interest rate is held to its current level of 16.5% per year, it will be possible to comply with inflation targets up to 2002. However, the leeway forecast at the previous meeting in relation to the target for 2000 has disappeared, while that forecast for 2001 has been sharply reduced. Exercises with alternative scenarios indicate that an adverse performance on the part of the grouping of foodstuffs could push inflation in 2000 to a level slightly above the 6% target. 
Both leading indicators for inflation and short-term forecasts were presented. The leading indicators point to successive decline in inflation between August and November, with a slight upturn in December. The nonstructural short-term models point to stable monthly inflation in the range of 0.5% from September to November. On average, these models indicate accumulated inflation of just over 6% for the year as a whole.
IPCA core inflation was also presented. The method used to calculate this figure excludes items for which monthly growth is above the distribution percentile of 80 or below the percentile of 20. In this procedure, those items that register change just once per year were smoothed out or, in other words, their impact was redistributed in equal shares in the month of the effective increase and over the other eleven months of the year. The IPCA core, which held at a monthly average of 0.40% during the course of the first half of the year, climbed to 0.58% in July.
The consumer price index – Brazil (IPC-BR) core announced by the FGV increased sharply from 0.16% in June to 0.74% in July, with accumulated 12 month growth of 4.6%. Though expansion is still well below that of the full index (7.73% over twelve months), this high may suggest the start of a period in which the core will settle down to a plateau above the monthly average of 0.28% registered in the first half of the year.
At its meeting on July 19, Copom reduced the Selic rate target from 17% to 16.5% per year, without indicating a bias.
In the period from July 19 to August 22, the monetary impact of definitive operations with Banco Central-issued securities generated expansion of R$ 1.0 billion and, in the case of operations with securities for which the National Treasury is liable, expansion came to R$ 4.9 billion. BBCE’s were offered on four different occasions. In the first public offer, three year papers were offered, moving to four year securities in the remaining offers.
In the period under analysis, the National Treasury made ten LTN sales, with a financial value of R$ 11.1 billion. Redemptions came to R$ 7.5 billion, of which R$ 3.8 billion took place ahead of time and were effected through two purchase auctions. The four LFT placements in public offers came to a total of R$ 9.1 billion, while redemptions added up to R$ 17.0 billion. There were no public offers of LFT on August 15 when the National Treasury sold only preset papers. On the 28th and 31st of July, the National Treasury made a public offer of five year NTN-C, with a total of R$ 0.5 billion in securities.
Banco Central operations on the secondary market came to a total of seven, covering a period of 25 business days, and had the objective of managing very short-term interest rates in the period under consideration. One should also stress that a committed sales auction of nonearmarked LTN was held on August 21.
Analysis of supply and demand indicates an absence of imbalances capable of generating inflationary pressures in the horizon relevant to the inflation targeting system. The pace of growth under consumption and investments seems to have slowed less than has been thought at the previous Copom meeting and is still within parameters fully compatible with price stability.
The expressive fiscal results obtained in the current year confirm the government’s commitment to austerity and stand as a guaranty that the targets defined in the Economic Program will be met. Aside from this, announcement of the 2002 fiscal target reflects the willingness of the public administration to continue firmly on this path in the future.
As regards the external scenario, the fact that the drop-off in the United States economy is still very tenuous, coupled with reasonable growth in the Euro Zone and Asia and significantly less volatility on financial and capital markets, would seem to favor growth in net exports. At the same time, these factors tend to improve the perceptions of risk in the emerging economies. Most specifically, the successful placement of bonds of the Republic with 40 year maturities and the steady reduction in the nation’s risk premium have greatly improved the outlook of Brazilian companies with respect to foreign financing.
Of the factors that have caused the greatest concern on the international scenario, petroleum is the most troublesome. The negative impact of oil prices has shown itself to be lasting while there is an increasing probability of new highs as the winter season takes hold in the northern hemisphere, at the same time in which the OPEC countries have transmitted only very vague signs of just how much oil they intend to pump. Should international prices remain where they are or move upward, it may become advisable to introduce internal adjustment measures.
The overall situation is consistent with compliance with inflation targets, though some degree of aggravation can be noted in a comparison to the previous meeting. Inflation in July as measured by the IPCA was far above the level forecast by both the market and Copom. An analysis of the components of the index point to highs under fuel prices, public services and some food products which, taken together, account for almost 90% of inflation. The conclusion drawn in this framework is that the high is transitory.
Aside from this, in the month of July, inflation measured by the IPCA core moved upward by about 0.6%, thus breaking out of the steady monthly pattern of 0.4% registered in the first half of the year. This question is pertinent since, over the medium and long terms, inflation measured by the core and observed inflation tend to converge. 
Once the data contained in more recent price indicators is incorporated into the forecasting instrument available to Copom, expected inflation in 2000 was revised upward by eliminating the margin that previously existed. In this context, an unexpected shock or contamination generated by other prices could raise the year’s level of inflation above the 6% target. Though this would not jeopardize compliance in 2000, it could imperil the trajectory expected for 2001. In this light, one is going to have to keep a very close eye on price evolution in order to clear up any doubts regarding the transitory nature of the shocks and their effect in the future.

04/10/2000;51;Arminio Fraga;"The major indicators of aggregate demand remained high at the start of the fourth quarter of the year. However, one should note that growth rates in recent months have been lower than those registered since the second half of 1999. According to the National Confederation of Industry, overall industrial sales in September remained practically stable (+0.1%) following a 1.5% decline in August. For the year up to October, accumulated growth in comparison to the same period of the previous year came to 10%.
Industrial sales of automotive vehicles, which had expanded sharply over the course of the year, dropped by 5.7% in September due, to some extent, to a lesser volume of foreign market sales. In October, however, the growth curve turned upward once again, registering accumulated expansion of 20.9% in the year, based on increases of 41.5% in exports and 16.1% in internal market sales. In much the same way, increased exports drove overall sales of farm machinery and motorcycles up by respective rates of 23.1% and 33%, when compared to the same period of 1999.
According to data seasonally adjusted by the Economic Department/Banco Central and released by the Trade Federation of the State of São Paulo (FCESP), real revenues of the São Paulo retail trade sector expanded in recent months at a pace of about 11% over the same 1999 period. To a great extent, this was due to expanded sales of items of greater unit value with the added stimulus of an increasingly greater flow of credit.
In November, the Consumer Confidence Index (ICC) stabilized in the range of 104.5 on a scale of 0 to 200. This index, which is also released by FCESP, registered a decline under current economic conditions and an increase under the item of future consumer expectations.
Based on preliminary data, the balance of business credits involving nonearmarked funding increased by 9.4% in the July-October period. Here, one should stress 20.5% growth in the discounting of trade bills, coupled with growth of 5% under exchange operations, which are much more significant in terms of value. Credits granted to individual persons have risen at an accelerated pace, registering growth of 28.1% in the same period. Of these, particular mention should be made of financing for acquisition of goods, with growth of 36.2% in the period under analysis. This performance was driven by such factors as longer average maturities in financing operations, interest rate reductions and lower levels of default in comparison to last year.
Information up to October on the number of consultations with the Trade Association of São Paulo (ACSP) points to stronger growth in installment sales when compared to sales with immediate payment in checks, with respective increases of 8.5% and 7.3%. According to the same source, the net default rate in São Paulo closed October at 5.8% or practically the same level as in the previous month.
Investment indicators have expanded in recent months, particularly under capital goods output. The strongest growth occurred under farm equipment, transportation equipment and products for the electrical energy sector. According to IPEA estimates, the investment rate came to 20% of GDP in the third quarter, continuing the steady positive growth curve that began from a low of 18.2% in June of last year. Investment growth would have been even more accentuated had it not been for the still somewhat sluggish performance of the building industry, as evident in growth of just 2%
under output of construction inputs in the January-September 2000 period when compared to the same period in 1999. In contrast to these results, capital goods output has accelerated briskly, reaching an accumulated 12.3% in the year up to September, at the same time in which the volume of capital goods imports has expanded steadily since July.
In the year up to October, the balance of trade turned in a surplus of US$ 194 million, as against a deficit of US$ 931 million in the same period of 1999. An analysis of bilateral trade shows a similar reversal of positions in operations with the European Union and the United States, while the surplus in trade operations within the Laia framework increased slightly. One of the factors that contributed to this result was a larger bilateral surplus in operations with Mexico, which was more than enough to offset an increased deficit in trade with Venezuela and Argentina.
Imports increased by 13.8% in relation to the January-October 1999 period, due mostly to 55% growth in outlays on fuels/lubricants caused by increases in international oil prices. Growth of 20% in purchases of raw materials was caused by expanded industrial production and greater exports of manufactured products. Total exports, in turn, expanded by 17% utilizing the same base of comparison. This growth was generated mostly by an increase of 23.7% in sales of manufactured products, principally involving aircraft, automobiles and transmission/reception equipment. Iron ore is the lead product among Brazil’s exports, with an accumulated total of US$ 2.6 billion in the January-October period.
Aggregate supply indicators point to steady growth throughout the year, with upturns under average utilization of installed output capacity, employment and industrial productivity. 
According to IBGE, GDP in the third quarter of the year registered its seventh consecutive positive result – at market prices – when compared to the previous quarter. In accumulated terms for the year, real growth closed at 3.89% as a result of 3.36% expansion under crop/livestock farming, 4.62% under industry and 3.29% under services. 
In terms of physical output, industrial production increased by 6.5% in the year up to September. Output of durable consumer goods led the way with expansion of 19.1%. Production of capital goods accelerated in September, raising accumulated growth in the year to 12.3%. Output of intermediate goods followed the same 7% to 8% pace that has characterized recent months, while output of semi and nondurable goods fell by 1.6% in the same period of comparison.
According to the FGV Survey, the utilization level of installed output capacity in the manufacturing sector came to 84.4% in October. The sector of intermediate goods reached a mark of 87.4% and came the closest to exhausting installed capacity. The same survey indicates that 37% of businesses are in a position to expand output with no apparent difficulties. This is the highest level under this indicator since October 1980.
According to a September IBGE survey, the grain harvest is expected to expand by 2% in the 1999/2000 harvest year, reaching a level of 84 million tons. Output of the north and northeast regions accounted for 12% of the total and registered expansion of 28.2%, offsetting the estimated 0.68% decline in the production of the south, southeast and centralwest regions brought about by adverse climatic factors.
Insofar as the job market is concerned, data accumulated up to September confirm the trend toward growth in both employment and productivity with no additional cost pressures. For the eleventh consecutive month, formal employment expanded in the month of September, with creation of 867 thousand job positions in the year. With exception of the building industry, all sectors turned in positive growth. Open unemployment fell for the eighth consecutive month and closed September at 6.68%.
Despite Opec’s recent decision to increase petroleum output, the upward price trend continued. Price formation in this market is strongly impacted by the political unrest in the Middle East, as well as by reports involving oil and derivative stock levels held by the United States, particularly in light of expectations of a sharp rise in consumption as winter weather begins to grip the northern hemisphere. However, the price curve on the futures market still points to a decline starting in the early months of 2001.
Insofar as the American economy is concerned, the Federal Open Market Committee met on November 15 and decided to maintain the basic interest rate target (fed funds) at 6.5% per year. The Committee recognized the risk of increased inflationary pressures generated by an expanding job market and higher energy prices. However, recent signs of a slowdown in demand growth coupled with financial market adjustments suggest that the economy may well continue expanding as a result of sharp growth in productivity while avoiding such pressures.
In the third quarter of the year, GDP expanded by 2.7% in annualized terms purged of seasonal influences, when compared to the previous quarter. Though industrial output declined by 0.1% in October, the accumulated figure for the last 12 months reflected 5.5% positive growth. Housing starts were 6% lower in September when compared to the same month of 1999. In 12 month terms, the accumulated decline closed at 2.95%. Finally, unemployment remained stable at 3.9% in October.
Insofar as inflation is concerned, the producer price index expanded by 0.4% in October, while core inflation dropped by 0.1%. At the consumer level, both the full and core indices registered growth of 0.2% in October, raising the year-over-year increases to 3.4% and 2.5%.
In Japan, more recent indicators point to a still incipient process of recovery. In September, housing starts increased by 2.1%, while family spending rose by 2.9% and industrial output fell by 3.4% when set against the previous month.
With regard to the Euro zone countries, indicators point to a slight slowdown in economic activity with some degree of upward movement under inflation. The single currency has come under significant pressure, leading the European Central Bank to intervene in the market three times in the month of November. The falloff in the euro, coupled with higher international oil prices, has contributed to higher inflation in the region, as demonstrated by growth of 0.5% in the harmonized consumer price index (CPI) and expansion of 0.9% under the producer price index in September.
In Argentina, the trade balance registered a surplus of US$ 1 billion in the January- September 2000 period, as compared to a deficit of US$ 1.3 billion in the same period of the previous year. At the same time, current revenues and expenditures expanded by 1.1% and 1.6%, respectively, when compared to the previous year’s results.
Uncertainties regarding fundamental aspects of the Argentine economy have come to the surface in recent weeks, resulting in increased sovereign risk perceptions and higher internal rates of interest. In this context, the government announced two sets of measures, one on October 23 and the other on November 10. The October initiatives were aimed at fostering private investment and, basically, stimulating economic activity, as the key to expanding employment and recovering previous tax inflow levels. The measures taken in November featured structural reform of the social security and labor systems and called for a pact between the central government and the provinces aimed at stabilizing public spending for five years. The reaction of financial markets to these measures was no more than lukewarm and financing costs remained very high. There was a better reaction to announcement of a possible financial assistance agreement with the IMF in an amount between US$ 10 billion and US$ 20 billion. However, this agreement will depend on congressional approval of measures aimed at bringing greater discipline to fiscal affairs, including passage of the 2001 budget and the social security reform bill, as well as the agreement already signed between the central government and the provinces.
Inflation declined once again in October, mostly as a result of a slowdown under farm prices and a drop in fuel prices.
The Broad Consumer Price Index (IPCA) turned in growth of 0.14% in October, with accumulated expansion of 5.02% in the year and 6.65% in the last 12 months. The 0.09 percentage point drop in relation to September was due to reductions in the growth pace of food prices from 0.53% in September to 0.16% in October. Other factors that contributed to this result were declines in the prices of fuel alcohol, cooking gas, gasoline, personal hygiene products and hairdresser services.
The General Price Index – Internal Supply (IGP-DI) turned in growth of 0.37% in October (0.69% in September), as a consequence of highs of 0.56% in the wholesale price index, 0.02% in the consumer price index and 0.33% in the cost of construction index. At the wholesale level, the greatest pressures were generated by farm prices, with growth of 0.8%, while industrial goods closed with an increase of 0.45%. A breakdown of the Consumer Price Index (IPC) indicates a falloff in the prices of goods classified under the groupings of foodstuffs, transportation and health/personal care. Utilizing the methodology of rounded averages, the core index closed with growth of 0.21%, above the rate for the full index.
Identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed in light of newly available information. The scenario considered in the simulations is based on the following hypotheses:
a. October inflation (0.14%), measured by the IPCA, closed below both market and Banco Central expectations. The subgrouping of meals taken at home registered growth of 0.16%, thus confirming the previous analysis that the shock that occurred in the July-August period was a passing phenomenon. Preliminary data on inflation measured by the other indices (IGP, IPC-Fipe) point to a downturn in food prices. Based on this evidence, the working hypothesis indicates stability in food prices up to the end of the year ,
b. the petroleum market has come under strong pressure that has sharply aggravated price volatility. Consequently, the working hypothesis incorporates the price increase approved for November 23, which is expected to produce an impact of about 8% on consumer prices. This impact will be incorporated into the IPCA at a rate of about one-fourth in November and three-fourths in December. At the same time, an additional factor is that oil prices in 2001 will follow the mean implicit in the futures market curve , 
c. with regard to government managed prices, due account was taken of the impact of adjustments in urban bus fares in those capital cities in which this year’s prices have
not increased in line with the average adjustments perceived by the IPCA. It is estimated that the total value of the adjustments in government managed prices will come to about 12% in 2000. The hypothesis for 2001 is that public service rates will be adjusted above inflation measured by the IPCA and that other government administered prices will follow the average of the other prices of the economy , 
d. with respect to the minimum wage in 2001, several hypotheses for the rate of increase, as well as different alternatives for scheduling these increases were utilized ,
e. the working hypothesis for November is a projection of inflation in line with market projections, coupled with recent evidence generated by preliminary inflation data , 
f. despite uncertainties on the external scenario, it is expected that interest rates in the United States will not change. This working hypothesis is consistent with the trajectories implicit in fed fund futures contracts.
The other hypotheses considered at the previous meeting were maintained, particularly that calling for a primary surplus based on the targets defined by fiscal policy. The average level of exchange for October and November was adjusted in light of the recent depreciation of the real.
Based on simulations with the scenario used in the basic model (structural), it was concluded that maintenance of interest rates at the current level of 16.5% per year will make it possible to comply with inflation targets for 2000 and 2001. At the same time, inflation projections for the current year were revised downward to a level closer to the 6% target.
Without considering the impact of the authorized increase in the prices of oil derivatives, the short-term nonstructural models project inflation at monthly rates below 0.4% up to the end of the year. In terms of the accumulated result for the year up to December, these models project inflation slightly above 6% when adjusted to perceive the recent increase in fuel prices.
IPCA core inflation calculated by Banco Central remained stable in October (0.42%), thus confirming the downturn that followed in the wake of the July-August increase. Core inflation measured by the Consumer Price Index – Brazil (IPC-Br), released by the Getúlio Vargas Foundation, came to 0.21%, which was close to the monthly average registered in the first half of the year (0.28%).
The daily survey carried out by Banco Central points to average IPCA growth expectations of 6.15% in 2000 and 4.28% in 2001. The relative stability of expectations in recent months confirms the temporary character of the July and August supply shocks.
For the fourth consecutive month, COPOM maintained the Selic rate target at 16.50% per year at its most recent meeting, with no indication of a bias. 
In the period between October 18 and November 21, NBCE were offered on six occasions in placements totaling R$ 6.1 billion, or a nominal updated redemption value of R$ 5.9 billion or R$ 6.9 billion when intermediate and final interest payments are included. These operations were in keeping with the objective of fully rolling the maturing exchange security debt, considering only final interest and the nominal updated redemption value. In the first two auctions, papers with five year terms were offered. These terms were later reduced to three and two years so as to meet the specific needs of exchange hedging.
The National Treasury carried out seven competitive sales of LTN, with a financial value of R$ 5.2 billion. Redemptions added up to R$ 6.1 billion, with R$ 0.4 billion in anticipated redemptions through a public purchase offer with two maturities – November 2000 and January 2001. For purposes of comparison, from September 20 to October 17, LTN placements surpassed redemptions by R$ 1.1 billion, even though redemptions totaled a full R$ 8.5 billion.
The five public offers of LFT came to R$ 8.2 billion, while redemptions of these papers totaled R$ 12.6 billion. In the first case, placements involved papers with maturities of three years at an average discount of 0.04% per year. Starting with the second auction, sales were limited exclusively to LFT with terms of four years at a discount in the range of 0.10% per year. One should note that, in the period from September 20 to October 17, LFT redemptions and placements came to respective totals of R$ 4.2 billion and R$ 4.7 billion.
One should also consider the renewed offer of five year NTN-C in two steps on October 30 and 31 with a total value of R$ 0.3 billion. Only 3.2% of this amount was liquidated with the use of securitized credits for which the National Treasury was liable.
The balance of definitive operations with federal public securities resulted in an expansionary monetary impact of R$ 5.9 billion. Contrary to what had occurred on previous occasions, this excess liquidity was not offset by the National Treasury cash surplus, but rather by the reduction in the volume of security purchases in open market operations carried out by Banco Central. These interventions, which were made with the objective of managing very short-term interest rates, occurred on four occasions for a total of 23 business days.
Despite a temporary slowdown in September output indices, more recent data confirm continued growth in aggregate demand and a steady pace of overall economic expansion. Consumption indicators reflect an increased supply of credit with lesser spreads and longer terms. Aggregate supply has reacted in a consistent manner, registering growth in employment levels, productivity and average utilization of installed industrial output capacity.
The prospects of growth in the coming year are positive. Industrial production indicators confirm that expansion has been powered by the performance of durable consumer goods as a result of both increased foreign sales and an expanding internal market, stimulated by a more ample flow of consumer credit. The outlook for growth in the farm sector in 2001 is also quite positive.
Analysis of supply and demand conditions reveals no significant pressures on inflation. Quite to the contrary, the recent behavior of inflation confirms Copom’s perception of a low degree of inertia built into the process of domestic price formation. Following the July and August supply shocks when inflation neared three percentage points in the two month period, the September and October results point to a rapid downturn and an accumulated rate of just 0.4 percentage points in the period.
In light of recent inflation results, Copom revised its expectations for inflation in the current year downward to a level close to the 6% target, even taking due account of the recently authorized increase in the prices of petroleum derivatives. For 2001, expectations are that inflation will close slightly below the target.
However, there are lingering doubts regarding the impact of a minimum wage increase on inflation. At the same time, one should also note that – in terms of the internal scenario - growing imports and an ample supply of foreign financing have contributed significantly to internal equilibrium. The increasingly more intense pace of economic growth has fired demand for goods and brought pressure to bear on the average level of utilization of the manufacturing sector’s installed output capacity, particularly under the heading of intermediate goods. The increased utilization of installed capacity in the intermediate goods industry has already begun impacting imports and the trade balance.
However, part of the recent upturn in imports is targeted at expanding exports, with an obvious beneficial impact on the trade balance. The year’s trade balance result should improve in relation to the past year, despite the direct negative impact on the balance of approximately US$ 2 billion generated by the high in petroleum prices. Over the medium term, further improvement in the trade balance is expected, given that investment flows have been reacting positively and, consequently, paving the way for steady and sustained growth in the economy.
The recent privatization of Banespa confirmed the economy’s potential for attracting longterm foreign resources. However, the external sector is a risk factor that must be considered. Though some uncertainties have been dissipated, the international financial market is marked by a high degree of aversion to risk and this could contribute to reductions in capital flows. Aside from this, pressures on international oil prices clearly tend to dampen the growth capacity of the world economy in 2001.
"
01/11/2000;52;Arminio Fraga;"Aggregate demand indicators demonstrate that industrial sales in the retail trade sector have continued at record levels, though the pace did slacken somewhat in the third quarter of the year.
Indicators issued by the National Confederation of Industry (CNI) and Federation of Industries of the State of São Paulo (FIESP) for the month of August revealed a certain leveling off of the growth trajectory under industrial sales. However, analysis of the accumulated figures for the year shows growth rates of 10.8% and 12.8%, respectively. Up to the month of September, sales by the automotive industry rose by 18.5% in accumulated terms for the year, with increases of 40.3% under exports and 13.5% in internal sales. The larger increase in foreign sales accounted for the growth in overall sales of farm machinery and motorcycles, as exports of the first item grew by 47.6% while the second racked up 103.6% in the same period.
According to seasonally adjusted data released by the Trade Federation of the State of São Paulo (FCESP), real revenues of the retail trade sector in the metropolitan region of São Paulo have been relatively stable in the last four months. Once seasonal factors are eliminated, growth has held firm in the range of 11% in relation to the same period of 1999. This result was considerably better than in other capital cities and, to some extent, can be attributed to the performance and weight of São Paulo industry.
The balance of credit operations based on nonearmarked resources increased by 4% in September, with accumulated growth of 8.2% in the third quarter. Total credits channeled to legal entities increased by 4.9% in the month and 6.8% in the quarter, while credits granted to individuals rose by 2.4% in September and 10.8% in the July-September period. One should stress that increased financing for acquisitions of goods was driven by longer average terms, lesser interest and lower default rates than in 1999.
Data on the number of consultations with the São Paulo Trade Association up to September continue pointing to more accentuated growth under installment sales than cash sales, with respective rates of 9% and 7.7%. Parallel to these results, one should also note 27.6% growth in the number of credit card transactions up to September, raising the participation of this type of payment to approximately 1/3 of overall transactions.
The Consumer Confidence Index (ICC) moved upward once again in October, closing at 104.5. This index, which is released by FCESP, registered recovery in both of its main components. This improvement was particularly strong under current economic conditions, which increased by 10.1% to its highest level since February. The item consumer expectations, which accounts for 60% of the index, rose by 5.9% in the month, though the average for the year is still 6% below the 1999 level.
With respect to investment indicators, output of capital goods in the month of August intensified (+7.4%, data purged of seasonal factors), raising accumulated growth to 11.4% in comparison to the January-August 1999 period. Production of building industry inputs has also increased over the course of the year, albeit at a pace that was considerably more moderate, accumulating just 2.3% using the same basis of comparison. Insofar as capital goods imports are concerned, imported volumes have followed a gradual upward curve in recent months, indicating that investments in the Brazilian economy have also shifted into a growth curve.
Up to the month of September, the balance of trade registered a surplus of US$ 717 million, as compared to a US$ 775 million deficit in the same period of 1999. Foreign sales increased by 18.2% in relation to the January-September 1999 period, principally as a result of growth of 25.1% in sales of manufactured goods. Here, one should stress increased sales of aircraft, automobiles and transmission/reception equipment. Taken together, in the period under consideration these items accounted for more than 40% of the growth in export revenues involving manufactured products. Iron ore continued as the major export product, accumulating revenues of US$ 2.3 billion in the year up to September.
Utilizing the same basis of comparison, imports increased by 13.6%, due mostly to greater outlays on fuels/lubricants and raw materials. In the first case, imports expanded by 57.1% as a result of higher international prices. Purchases of the latter item expanded by 20.3%, with accentuated growth under imported raw materials. This result was a consequence of increased industrial output and growth in foreign sales of those manufactured goods that are more dependent on imported inputs.
Aggregate supply indicators have registered steady growth during the year, as idle industrial output capacity has declined and both productivity and employment have moved upward.
Industrial output increased by an accumulated rate of 6.9% up to August, based on growth in all use categories. Production of consumer durables continues as the performance leader, with growth of 21.5%, followed by capital goods with expansion of 11.4% in the year. In recent months, output of intermediate goods has expanded at a steady rate of approximately 8% in accumulated terms for the year, while production of semidurable and nondurable consumer goods dropped by 1.1% in the same period of comparison. 
According to the National Confederation of Industry (CNI), the level of utilization of installed capacity reached 81.8% in the month of August. Though this is the highest level registered by the statistical series, the possibility of bottlenecks in the flow of goods is limited to a few intermediate goods subsectors.
In the primary sector, IBGE estimates for the month of August indicated growth of 1.9% in the 1999/2000 grain harvest, with a total of 83.9 million tons. Since the previous forecast for the soybean harvest was revised upward by a volume greater than the reduction for the wheat harvest estimated in the most recent survey, the final result was greater than the overall output volume forecast in the previous month.
With regard to the labor market, accumulated data up to the month of August indicate that both employment and productivity have been moving steadily upward, without generating undue cost pressures. Formal employment expanded for the tenth consecutive month, with creation of 775 thousand job positions in the year. With the sole exception of the building industry, all sectors of the economy registered positive employment growth. Open unemployment dropped to 7.14% in August, the seventh consecutive monthly reduction.
In recent weeks, concern has mounted as to the real possibility of increasing the supply of crude oil and its derivatives over the coming months, particularly at a time in which demand is also expanding. The result of this worrisome situation has been a high degree of price volatility in recent weeks. The stock levels of these products are considered insufficient, since they were allowed to dwindle as potential buyers initially sought to avoid importing at higher prices. At the same time, the political tensions that have surfaced in the Middle East recently have contributed to a very jittery market.
In the case of the United States economy, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to hold the basic interest target (fed funds) at 6.5% per year at its October 3 meeting. The Committee concluded that recent data point to a more moderate pace of growth under aggregate demand, bringing this variable more into line with the growth potential of the economy. Greater productivity gains have also aided in curtailing costs and attenuating pressures on core inflation, despite a situation of very low unemployment.
The increase in energy costs was noted in a 5.3% high under raw materials in September, resulting in growth of 0.9% in the Producer Price Index (IPP), a level that was considerably higher than the originally forecast rate of 0.5%. Twelve month expansion moved from 3.2% in the previous month to 3.3%. The IPP core rose by 0.3% in September (0.1% in August) as against a forecast level of 0.2%. The accumulated result over twelve months dropped from 1.5% to 1.2% in September.
More recent indicators for the Japanese economy point to improvement in the economic environment. The Tankan Business Confidence Index for the manufacturing sector expanded from 3 to 10 in the period, a full 6 points above the expected mark. At the same time, the index that measures supply and demand conditions increased from –24 to –18 in the period from the second to the third quarters of this year. The jobless rate dropped to 4.6% in August, after holding steady at 4.7% in both June and July. In the month of August, the headings of orders placed with industry, industrial output and new housing starts also moved into a positive growth curve.
Going on to the euro zone countries, signs of increased economic activity are becoming increasingly clearer. Just as expected, July industrial output expanded by 0.5%, raising annual growth to 5.1%, as against 3.7% in June. Unemployment held steady at 9% in August, thus matching the revised June and July figures. On September 22, the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank and Bank of Japan moved to shore up the euro. However, this effort, coupled with an October 5 increase in interest rates, was not sufficient to reverse the slide in the value of the single European currency. The euro’s performance and international oil price highs have contributed importantly to higher inflation in the region, as confirmed by the 0.5% hike in the Harmonized Consumer Price Index for the month of September, which raised accumulated inflation over 12 months from 2.3% to 2.8%. The September result for this index was fully in keeping with expectations. 
In Argentina, the oil price high was the item most responsible for growth in exports and the consequent reduction in the country’s trade balance deficit. Industrial output in August declined by 2.9%, pushing annual growth down to 1.7%, as against 2.2% in July. Current revenues and expenditures increased by 2% and 1.9%, respectively, from January to August 2000, compared to the same 1999 period.
Lesser farm product prices and dissipation of the impact of recent increases in government managed prices pushed inflation into a downward curve in September.
The Broad Consumer Price Index (IPCA) rose by 0.23% in September, with 4.87% growth in the year and 7.77% in the last 12 months. The 1.08 percentage drop in relation to August growth was mostly due to a falloff in the growth pace of food and alcohol prices, coupled with a reduction in gasoline and bottled gas prices. The grouping of food and beverages registered a high of 0.53% in the month. The pressures generated in recent months by higher alcohol prices – median increases of 13.44% in July and 16.7% in August – were greatly attenuated in September, as the month closed with growth of just 0.81%. Negative growth in the month was also registered under residential rents, personal hygiene products, pharmaceutical goods and new automotive vehicles.
The September General Price Index – Internal Supply (IGP-DI) increased by 0.69% in September, as against 1.82% in August. This result was due to lesser growth in the Wholesale Price Index (1.09% against 2.56%), Consumer Price Index (0.04% compared to 0.86%) and Cost of Construction Index (0.26% against 0.39%). The greatest pressures on the Wholesale Price Index (IPA) were generated by farm prices. Though these prices cooled somewhat in the month, they still closed with 2.03% positive growth, while the prices of industrial products rose by 0.67%. An analysis of the Consumer Price Index (IPC) shows that the major product groupings closed quite close to the median range. The IPC core ended September with 0.13% growth, with an accumulated total of 3.81% in the year and 4.39% in the last 12 months.
Based on newly available information, already identified shocks and their impacts on the economy were subjected to review. The scenario considered in simulation exercises was based on the following hypotheses:
a. inflation in September (0.23%) was slightly below the expected level (0.4%). The subgrouping of Meals at Home increased by 0.61%, confirming the previous analysis that the shock that had occurred under this heading would be short-lived and its effects rapidly absorbed. Consequently, the forecast of an increase of one percent for food prices in general in the fourth quarter of 2000 was maintained ,
b. oil market prices are in the midst of a period of great volatility, as already existent worries have been worsened by growing turmoil in the Middle East. However, notwithstanding slight growth in futures market prices, the structure of futures still points to a succession of monthly declines in 2001. With this, the hypothesis of an additional increase in domestic fuel prices in the current year was maintained in the basic scenario ,
c. with regard to other government managed prices, the scenario incorporates the impact of a possible rise in public transportation rates in those municipalities that have not yet authorized an annual increase. The same situation exists in the case of Rio de Janeiro electricity rates. These hypotheses point to an average increase of 12.2% for government managed prices in general in 2000, with a direct impact of 2.8 percentage points on inflation for the year. Insofar as 2001 is concerned, the hypothesis that public service rates will follow the growth pattern estimated for the general indices used in the respective contracts and that other government managed prices will accompany the median increase of the other prices of the economy was maintained ,
d. despite increased uncertainty regarding the external environment, particularly the slowdown in the United States economy and devaluation of the euro, the federal fund interest rate trajectory implicit in futures contracts has not changed from the previous level of 6.5% per year, the level utilized in the simulations.
The other hypotheses considered at the previous meeting were maintained, particularly with respect to a primary surplus in keeping with the targets defined in fiscal policy and GDP growth compatible with a state of equilibrium between aggregate supply and demand.
The conclusions drawn from the simulation exercises with this scenario confirm that interest at the current level of 16.5% per year will make it possible to comply with inflation targets up to 2002.
The short-term nonstructural models project inflation at monthly rates of less than 0.4% up to December 2000. In accumulated terms for the year, these models point to a median level of IPCA growth just under 6%.
IPCA core inflation was also presented. The result was a monthly average of 0.4% in the first half of the year, increasing to 0.58% in July and 0.6% in August, before dropping to 0.42% in September. Core inflation measured by the Consumer Price Index – Brazil (IPCBR), which is released by the Getúlio Vargas Foundation, dropped from 0.27% in August to 0.13% in September, or approximately half the monthly median rate of 0.28% registered in the first six months of the year. 
The daily Banco Central market survey indicates that median expectations regarding IPCA growth dropped slightly since the previous Copom meeting. For 2000 as a whole, estimates were revised downward from 6.3% to 6.2%, while the expected rate for 2001 was cut from 4.4% to 4.3%.
For the third consecutive time, the September 20 Copom meeting was marked by a decision to hold the Selic rate target to 16.50% per year with no indication of a bias.
This decision was expected by practically all the financial institutions consulted by DEMAB. Among other factors, this rather conservative posture was justified by the continued volatility of international market oil prices, always at very high levels.
In the period between September 20 and October 17, definitive operations with papers issued by Banco Central and the National Treasury registered contraction of R$ 0.9 billion. 
NBCE offers were made on three occasions, with a total placement value of R$ 3.3 billion. In the first two, these papers were negotiated with terms of four years, while the third offer was placed with a five year term.
The National Treasury effected eight LTN sales, with a total financial value of R$ 9.6 billion. Redemptions came to R$ 8.5 billion, of which R$ 2.2 billion represented early redemptions through public purchase offers encompassing three maturities. Interest on LTN placements with maturities of six months and one year followed a slightly downward curve.  LFT were offered on four different occasions, with a total value of R$ 4.7 billion, while redemptions added up to R$ 4.2 billion. There was also a renewed offer of five year NTN-C, with a total value of R$ 0.5 billion. Banco Central acted on seven different occasions over a total period of 19 business days, with the aim of managing very short-term secondary market interest rates. In all of these interventions, federal securities with resale commitments were purchased, in order to eliminate excess banking reserve market demand.
The growth pace of economic activity has remained solid and steady and well within parameters considered compatible with continued price stability. With the increased supply of credit and greater consumer confidence, aggregate demand indicators point to robust expansion. The value of imports has risen in comparison to last year, principally as a consequence of increased outlays on fuels and lubricants, but also due to larger purchases of raw materials. One of the driving forces underlying this expansion has been growth in exports of manufactured products.
Industry has responded adequately to increased demand by expanding not only average utilization of output capacity, but output capacity itself. Potential bottlenecks in the future output flow of some productive sectors of the economy should be avoided through increased investments. At the same time, the prospects of a plentiful farm harvest will certainly contribute to favorable expectations regarding next year’s total output.
Following a brief peak in previous months, the September decline in inflation further strengthens the thesis that there is a very low degree of inertia in the economy at present. This thesis supports expectations of a further decline in inflation in October. For the year, Copom has maintained its expectations, even considering the possibility of an increase in government managed prices by the end of the year (public transportation and fuels). 
Nonetheless, there is a significant risk factor in the external scenario. The volatility of
international oil prices has worsened. Though futures market operations have pointed in the direction of a price decline during the course of the year, one should not expect anything less than US$ 27 per barrel for Brent crude up to the end of next year. Parallel to this, the prices of the foreign securities of emerging markets, particularly in Latin America, have been marked by increasing volatility, due to a great extent to uncertainties generated by the troubles in the Middle East and by devaluation of the euro. It was concluded, however, that the underlying conditions of the international economy do not seem to have changed in any substantial way since the previous Copom meeting. Growth prospects have improved for Japan and are still quite good for the euro zone, despite the considerable uncertainty generated by the steady weakening of the new currency. In the United States, the trajectory implicit in futures contracts does not point to any probability of a change in basic interest rates in coming months.

07/12/2000;53;Arminio Fraga;"The major indicators of aggregate demand remained high at the start of the fourth quarter of the year. However, one should note that growth rates in recent months have been lower than those registered since the second half of 1999. According to the National Confederation of Industry, overall industrial sales in September remained practically stable (+0.1%) following a 1.5% decline in August. For the year up to October, accumulated growth in comparison to the same period of the previous year came to 10%.  
Industrial sales of automotive vehicles, which had expanded sharply over the course of the year, dropped by 5.7% in September due, to some extent, to a lesser volume of foreign market sales. In October, however, the growth curve turned upward once again, registering accumulated expansion of 20.9% in the year, based on increases of 41.5% in exports and 16.1% in internal market sales. In much the same way, increased exports drove overall sales of farm machinery and motorcycles up by respective rates of 23.1% and 33%, when compared to the same period of 1999.
According to data seasonally adjusted by the Economic Department/Banco Central and released by the Trade Federation of the State of São Paulo (FCESP), real revenues of the São Paulo retail trade sector expanded in recent months at a pace of about 11% over the same 1999 period. To a great extent, this was due to expanded sales of items of greater unit value with the added stimulus of an increasingly greater flow of credit. 
In November, the Consumer Confidence Index (ICC) stabilized in the range of 104.5 on a scale of 0 to 200. This index, which is also released by FCESP, registered a decline under current economic conditions and an increase under the item of future consumer expectations. 
Based on preliminary data, the balance of business credits involving nonearmarked funding increased by 9.4% in the July-October period. Here, one should stress 20.5% growth in the discounting of trade bills, coupled with growth of 5% under exchange operations, which are much more significant in terms of value. Credits granted to individual persons have risen at an accelerated pace, registering growth of 28.1% in the same period. Of these, particular mention should be made of financing for acquisition of goods, with growth of 36.2% in the period under analysis. This performance was driven by such factors as longer average maturities in financing operations, interest rate reductions and lower levels of default in comparison to last year. 
Information up to October on the number of consultations with the Trade Association of São Paulo (ACSP) points to stronger growth in installment sales when compared to sales with immediate payment in checks, with respective increases of 8.5% and 7.3%. According to the same source, the net default rate in São Paulo closed October at 5.8% or practically the same level as in the previous month.
Investment indicators have expanded in recent months, particularly under capital goods output. The strongest growth occurred under farm equipment, transportation equipment and products for the electrical energy sector. According to IPEA estimates, the investment rate came to 20% of GDP in the third quarter, continuing the steady positive growth curve that began from a low of 18.2% in June of last year. Investment growth would have been even more accentuated had it not been for the still somewhat sluggish performance of the building industry, as evident in growth of just 2% under output of construction inputs in the January-September 2000 period when compared to the same period in 1999. In contrast to these results, capital goods output has accelerated briskly, reaching an accumulated 12.3% in the year up to September, at the same time in which the volume of capital goods imports has expanded steadily since July.
In the year up to October, the balance of trade turned in a surplus of US$ 194 million, as against a deficit of US$ 931 million in the same period of 1999. An analysis of bilateral trade shows a similar reversal of positions in operations with the European Union and the United States, while the surplus in trade operations within the Laia framework increased slightly. One of the factors that contributed to this result was a larger bilateral surplus in operations with Mexico, which was more than enough to offset an increased deficit in trade with Venezuela and Argentina. 
Imports increased by 13.8% in relation to the January-October 1999 period, due mostly to 55% growth in outlays on fuels/lubricants caused by increases in international oil prices. Growth of 20% in purchases of raw materials was caused by expanded industrial production and greater exports of manufactured products. Total exports, in turn, expanded by 17% utilizing the same base of comparison. This growth was generated mostly by an increase of 23.7% in sales of manufactured products, principally involving aircraft, automobiles and transmission/reception equipment. Iron ore is the lead product among Brazil’s exports, with an accumulated total of US$ 2.6 billion in the January-October period.
Aggregate supply indicators point to steady growth throughout the year, with upturns under average utilization of installed output capacity, employment and industrial productivity. 
According to IBGE, GDP in the third quarter of the year registered its seventh consecutive positive result – at market prices – when compared to the previous quarter. In accumulated terms for the year, real growth closed at 3.89% as a result of 3.36% expansion under crop/livestock farming, 4.62% under industry and 3.29% under services.
In terms of physical output, industrial production increased by 6.5% in the year up to September. Output of durable consumer goods led the way with expansion of 19.1%.  Production of capital goods accelerated in September, raising accumulated growth in the year to 12.3%. Output of intermediate goods followed the same 7% to 8% pace that has characterized recent months, while output of semi and nondurable goods fell by 1.6% in the same period of comparison.
According to the FGV Survey, the utilization level of installed output capacity in the manufacturing sector came to 84.4% in October. The sector of intermediate goods reached a mark of 87.4% and came the closest to exhausting installed capacity. The same survey indicates that 37% of businesses are in a position to expand output with no apparent difficulties. This is the highest level under this indicator since October 1980.
According to a September IBGE survey, the grain harvest is expected to expand by 2% in the 1999/2000 harvest year, reaching a level of 84 million tons. Output of the north and northeast regions accounted for 12% of the total and registered expansion of 28.2%, offsetting the estimated 0.68% decline in the production of the south, southeast and centralwest regions brought about by adverse climatic factors
Insofar as the job market is concerned, data accumulated up to September confirm the trend toward growth in both employment and productivity with no additional cost pressures. For the eleventh consecutive month, formal employment expanded in the month of September, with creation of 867 thousand job positions in the year. With exception of the building industry, all sectors turned in positive growth. Open unemployment fell for the eighth consecutive month and closed September at 6.68%.
Despite Opec’s recent decision to increase petroleum output, the upward price trend continued. Price formation in this market is strongly impacted by the political unrest in the Middle East, as well as by reports involving oil and derivative stock levels held by the United States, particularly in light of expectations of a sharp rise in consumption as winter weather begins to grip the northern hemisphere. However, the price curve on the futures market still points to a decline starting in the early months of 2001.
Insofar as the American economy is concerned, the Federal Open Market Committee met on  November 15 and decided to maintain the basic interest rate target (fed funds) at 6.5% per year. The Committee recognized the risk of increased inflationary pressures generated by an expanding job market and higher energy prices. However, recent signs of a slowdown in demand growth coupled with financial market adjustments suggest that the economy may well continue expanding as a result of sharp growth in productivity while avoiding such pressures. 
In the third quarter of the year, GDP expanded by 2.7% in annualized terms purged of seasonal influences, when compared to the previous quarter. Though industrial output declined by 0.1% in October, the accumulated figure for the last 12 months reflected 5.5% positive growth. Housing starts were 6% lower in September when compared to the same month of 1999. In 12 month terms, the accumulated decline closed at 2.95%. Finally, unemployment remained stable at 3.9% in October.
Insofar as inflation is concerned, the producer price index expanded by 0.4% in October, while core inflation dropped by 0.1%. At the consumer level, both the full and core indices registered growth of 0.2% in October, raising the year-over-year increases to 3.4% and 2.5%.
In Japan, more recent indicators point to a still incipient process of recovery. In September, housing starts increased by 2.1%, while family spending rose by 2.9% and industrial output fell by 3.4% when set against the previous month. 
With regard to the Euro zone countries, indicators point to a slight slowdown in economic activity with some degree of upward movement under inflation. The single currency has come under significant pressure, leading the European Central Bank to intervene in the market three times in the month of November. The falloff in the euro, coupled with higher international oil prices, has contributed to higher inflation in the region, as demonstrated by growth of 0.5% in the harmonized consumer price index (CPI) and expansion of 0.9% under the producer price index in September.
In Argentina, the trade balance registered a surplus of US$ 1 billion in the January- September 2000 period, as compared to a deficit of US$ 1.3 billion in the same period of the previous year. At the same time, current revenues and expenditures expanded by 1.1% and  1.6%, respectively, when compared to the previous year’s results.
Uncertainties regarding fundamental aspects of the Argentine economy have come to the surface in recent weeks, resulting in increased sovereign risk perceptions and higher internal rates of interest. In this context, the government announced two sets of measures, one on October 23 and the other on November 10. The October initiatives were aimed at fostering private investment and, basically, stimulating economic activity, as the key to expanding employment and recovering previous tax inflow levels. The measures taken in November featured structural reform of the social security and labor systems and called for a pact between the central government and the provinces aimed at stabilizing public spending for five years. The reaction of financial markets to these measures was no more than lukewarm and financing costs remained very high. There was a better reaction to announcement of a possible financial assistance agreement with the IMF in an amount between US$ 10 billion and US$ 20 billion. However, this agreement will depend on congressional approval of measures aimed at bringing greater discipline to fiscal affairs, including passage of the 2001 budget and the social security reform bill, as well as the agreement already signed between the central government and the provinces. 
Inflation declined once again in October, mostly as a result of a slowdown under farm prices and a drop in fuel prices. 
The Broad Consumer Price Index (IPCA) turned in growth of 0.14% in October, with accumulated expansion of 5.02% in the year and 6.65% in the last 12 months. The 0.09 percentage point drop in relation to September was due to reductions in the growth pace of food prices from 0.53% in September to 0.16% in October. Other factors that contributed to this result were declines in the prices of fuel alcohol, cooking gas, gasoline, personal hygiene products and hairdresser services. 
The General Price Index – Internal Supply (IGP-DI) turned in growth of 0.37% in October (0.69% in September), as a consequence of highs of 0.56% in the wholesale price index, 0.02% in the consumer price index and 0.33% in the cost of construction index. At the wholesale level, the greatest pressures were generated by farm prices, with growth of 0.8%,  while industrial goods closed with an increase of 0.45%. A breakdown of the Consumer Price Index (IPC) indicates a falloff in the prices of goods classified under the groupings of foodstuffs, transportation and health/personal care. Utilizing the methodology of rounded averages, the core index closed with growth of 0.21%, above the rate for the full index.
Identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed in light of newly available information. The scenario considered in the simulations is based on the following hypotheses: 
a. October inflation (0.14%), measured by the IPCA, closed below both market and Banco Central expectations. The subgrouping of meals taken at home registered growth of 0.16%, thus confirming the previous analysis that the shock that occurred in the July-August period was a passing phenomenon. Preliminary data on inflation measured by the other indices (IGP, IPC-Fipe) point to a downturn in food prices. Based on this evidence, the working hypothesis indicates stability in food prices up to the end of the year, 
b. the petroleum market has come under strong pressure that has sharply aggravated price volatility. Consequently, the working hypothesis incorporates the price increase approved for November 23, which is expected to produce an impact of about 8% on consumer prices. This impact will be incorporated into the IPCA at a rate of about one-fourth in November and three-fourths in December. At the same time, an additional factor is that oil prices in 2001 will follow the mean implicit in the futures market curve, 
c. with regard to government managed prices, due account was taken of the impact of adjustments in urban bus fares in those capital cities in which this year’s prices have not increased in line with the average adjustments perceived by the IPCA. It is estimated that the total value of the adjustments in government managed prices will come to about 12% in 2000. The hypothesis for 2001 is that public service rates will be adjusted above inflation measured by the IPCA and that other government administered prices will follow the average of the other prices of the economy, 
d. with respect to the minimum wage in 2001, several hypotheses for the rate of increase, as well as different alternatives for scheduling these increases were utilized, 
e. the working hypothesis for November is a projection of inflation in line with market  projections, coupled with recent evidence generated by preliminary inflation data,
f. despite uncertainties on the external scenario, it is expected that interest rates in the United States will not change. This working hypothesis is consistent with the trajectories implicit in fed fund futures contracts. The other hypotheses considered at the previous meeting were maintained, particularly that calling for a primary surplus based on the targets defined by fiscal policy. The average level of exchange for October and November was adjusted in light of the recent depreciation of the real
Based on simulations with the scenario used in the basic model (structural), it was concluded that maintenance of interest rates at the current level of 16.5% per year will make it possible to comply with inflation targets for 2000 and 2001. At the same time, inflation projections for the current year were revised downward to a level closer to the 6% target. 
Without considering the impact of the authorized increase in the prices of oil derivatives, the short-term nonstructural models project inflation at monthly rates below 0.4% up to the end of the year. In terms of the accumulated result for the year up to December, these models project inflation slightly above 6% when adjusted to perceive the recent increase in fuel prices.
IPCA core inflation calculated by Banco Central remained stable in October (0.42%), thus confirming the downturn that followed in the wake of the July-August increase. Core inflation measured by the Consumer Price Index – Brazil (IPC-Br), released by the Getúlio Vargas Foundation, came to 0.21%, which was close to the monthly average registered in the first half of the year (0.28%).
The daily survey carried out by Banco Central points to average IPCA growth expectations of 6.15% in 2000 and 4.28% in 2001. The relative stability of expectations in recent months confirms the temporary character of the July and August supply shocks.  
For the fourth consecutive month, COPOM maintained the Selic rate target at 16.50% per  _ year at its most recent meeting, with no indication of a bias.
In the period between October 18 and November 21, NBCE were offered on six occasions in placements totaling R$ 6.1 billion, or a nominal updated redemption value of R$ 5.9 billion or R$ 6.9 billion when intermediate and final interest payments are included. These operations were in keeping with the objective of fully rolling the maturing exchange security debt, considering only final interest and the nominal updated redemption value. In the first two auctions, papers with five year terms were offered. These terms were later reduced to three and two years so as to meet the specific needs of exchange hedging. 
The National Treasury carried out seven competitive sales of LTN, with a financial value of R$ 5.2 billion. Redemptions added up to R$ 6.1 billion, with R$ 0.4 billion in anticipated redemptions through a public purchase offer with two maturities – November 2000 and January 2001. For purposes of comparison, from September 20 to October 17, LTN placements surpassed redemptions by R$ 1.1 billion, even though redemptions totaled a full R$ 8.5 billion.
The five public offers of LFT came to R$ 8.2 billion, while redemptions of these papers totaled R$ 12.6 billion. In the first case, placements involved papers with maturities of three years at an average discount of 0.04% per year. Starting with the second auction, sales were limited exclusively to LFT with terms of four years at a discount in the range of 0.10% per year. One should note that, in the period from September 20 to October 17, LFT redemptions and placements came to respective totals of R$ 4.2 billion and R$ 4.7 billion. 
One should also consider the renewed offer of five year NTN-C in two steps on October 30 and 31 with a total value of R$ 0.3 billion. Only 3.2% of this amount was liquidated with the use of securitized credits for which the National Treasury was liable. 
The balance of definitive operations with federal public securities resulted in an expansionary monetary impact of R$ 5.9 billion. Contrary to what had occurred on previous occasions, this excess liquidity was not offset by the National Treasury cash surplus, but rather by the reduction in the volume of security purchases in open market operations carried out by Banco Central. These interventions, which were made with the objective of managing  _ very short-term interest rates, occurred on four occasions for a total of 23 business days. 
Despite a temporary slowdown in September output indices, more recent data confirm continued growth in aggregate demand and a steady pace of overall economic expansion. Consumption indicators reflect an increased supply of credit with lesser spreads and longer terms. Aggregate supply has reacted in a consistent manner, registering growth in employment levels, productivity and average utilization of installed industrial output capacity. 
The prospects of growth in the coming year are positive. Industrial production indicators confirm that expansion has been powered by the performance of durable consumer goods as a result of both increased foreign sales and an expanding internal market, stimulated by a more ample flow of consumer credit. The outlook for growth in the farm sector in 2001 is also quite positive. 
Analysis of supply and demand conditions reveals no significant pressures on inflation. Quite to the contrary, the recent behavior of inflation confirms Copom’s perception of a low degree of inertia built into the process of domestic price formation. Following the July and August supply shocks when inflation neared three percentage points in the two month period, the September and October results point to a rapid downturn and an accumulated rate of just 0.4 percentage points in the period.
In light of recent inflation results, Copom revised its expectations for inflation in the current year downward to a level close to the 6% target, even taking due account of the recently authorized increase in the prices of petroleum derivatives. For 2001, expectations are that inflation will close slightly below the target. 
However, there are lingering doubts regarding the impact of a minimum wage increase on inflation. At the same time, one should also note that – in terms of the internal scenario - growing imports and an ample supply of foreign financing have contributed significantly to internal equilibrium. The increasingly more intense pace of economic growth has fired demand for goods and brought pressure to bear on the average level of utilization of the  _ manufacturing sector’s installed output capacity, particularly under the heading of intermediate goods. The increased utilization of installed capacity in the intermediate goods industry has already begun impacting imports and the trade balance.
However, part of the recent upturn in imports is targeted at expanding exports, with an obvious beneficial impact on the trade balance. The year’s trade balance result should improve in relation to the past year, despite the direct negative impact on the balance of approximately US$ 2 billion generated by the high in petroleum prices. Over the medium term, further improvement in the trade balance is expected, given that investment flows have been reacting positively and, consequently, paving the way for steady and sustained growth in the economy. 
The recent privatization of Banespa confirmed the economy’s potential for attracting longterm foreign resources. However, the external sector is a risk factor that must be considered. Though some uncertainties have been dissipated, the international financial market is marked by a high degree of aversion to risk and this could contribute to reductions in capital flows. Aside from this, pressures on international oil prices clearly tend to dampen the growth capacity of the world economy in 2001.

Demand indicators showed increase over the fourth quarter, a change favored by credit and exports expansion, better expectations and, more recently, by a recovery in employment levels.
Industrial sales of automotive vehicles expanded 22.2% in the yearly aggregate up to November, increasing 36.6% in exports and 18.7% in domestic sales. The increased exports have also driven total sales of agricultural machines and motorcycles, which grew 27.4% and 34.7%, respectively, as against the same period of 1999. 
Still regarding industrial sales, October seasonally adjusted data from the National Confederation of Industry (CNI) and the São Paulo Federation of Industries (FIESP) point towards a monthly growth of 2.1% and 1.8%, respectively, and of 10.6% and 13.3% in the yearly aggregate up to October, as against the same period of 1999. In October, according to the Trade Federation of the State of São Paulo seasonally adjusted data, real revenues of the retail trade increased 0.4% as against the previous month and 8.7% as against October 1999. All segments surveyed, except building materials, displayed expansion when compared to September. In accumulated terms for the year, the rate of growth kept around 11% above the same period of 1999. Consumer durables and automobiles led the sales. The recent expansion in supermarket sales increased the sales of non-durables to 14.7% in the yearly aggregate up to November. 
The Consumer Confidence Index (ICC) increased from 104.5 in November to 105.5 in December, on a 0 to 200 range. This indicator, also published by FCESP, displayed an increase of 6.2% in the item current economic conditions and a decrease of 1.2% in the consumer’s future expectations. 
The balance of credit operations with non-earmarked funding increased 4.8% in November, aggregating 20% along the second half of the year. Credits granted to individual persons increased at a more accelerated pace, registering growth of 27.5% in the same period. Credit for the purchase of vehicles expanded 72.6%, fostered by an increase in average credit terms, drop in interest rates and a reduction in average default levels.
Production of capital goods kept accelerating in October, reaching 12.9% in the yearly aggregate, while imports of capital goods resumed growth in quantity by the monthly comparison since the beginning of the second half of the year. The building industry displayed a less dynamic performance, as shown by an expansion of 2% in production of inputs in the period January-October when compared to the same period of 1999.
The trade balance recorded a negative balance of US$ 630 million in November, aggregating a deficit of US$ 478 million over the year. An increase in petroleum prices is to blame for these results, reflecting the increase in this product price. 
Imports of raw materials increased 18.9% in the yearly aggregate up to November, as against equal period of 1999, as a consequence of an increase in quantities. This performance was partially due to the economy growth and to an expansion of 22% in manufacture exports, which incorporated imported components. Exports of basic products grew 8% up to November, also reflecting an expansion in quantities shipped, with still decreasing prices. Regarding semi-manufactures, an increase in prices was observed while quantities exported diminished in past months. 
Aggregate supply indicators point to a growth throughout the year, with upturns under average utilization of installed output capacity, employment and industrial productivity.
In October, industrial production resumed growth, overcoming the drops observed in August and September. The monthly production was the higher in 2000, second in the seasonally adjusted series only to the result of December 1994. The yearly aggregate growth reached 6.6% in October, keeping relatively constant since the middle of the year, even when considering a comparison period in which the production was under recovery. Among  _ industrial sectors, transportation material recorded the higher growth rate, followed by mechanical industry, rubber, electric materials, and by communication and mineral extraction sectors. 
An analysis by use categories confirms the better yearly performance of consumer durables and capital goods production, reflecting improved credit conditions, increased investment and better exports performance. Production of intermediary goods keeps following the increase in the manufacture of final goods, growing from 7% to 8% and recording higher levels of output. It is worth mentioning a 35.1% expansion in production of capital goods parts and spares, 12.1% in vehicle parts, and 11% in petroleum and gas extraction, as well as sub-sectors producing industrial inputs, such as iron and steel mills, petrochemicals, fertilizers and textiles.
According to seasonally adjusted CNI data, the utilization level of installed output capacity in the manufacturing sector came to 80.9% in October. Some industrial categories which manufacture intermediate goods are operating close to their full installed capacity. 
According to an October IBGE survey, the grain harvest is expected to expand by 1.9% in the 1999/2000 harvest year, reaching a level of 83.9 million tons. Regarding sowing intentions and already sowed areas for the 2001 harvest, a survey performed in October indicated an increase of 0.4% in sowed area as against the 2000 harvest. 
As regards the labor market, the trend of increased employment and productivity persisted, accommodating the recent salary negotiations without affecting costs. For the thirteenth consecutive month, formal employment expanded in the month of October, with creation of 883 thousand job positions in the year. With exception of the building industry, all sectors displayed employment growth. Open unemployment rates remained fairly stable at 6.7% in October.
Since the end of November, the increased price trend in the petroleum market was reverted, with the OPEP basket reducing from about US$ 31.50/b to US$ 25/b. Market conditions suggest an excess of global supply, in spite of the recent exports suspension by Iraq. The market kept volatile, with sharp drops in prices, a movement amplified by commodities investment funds, which inverted their positions in the derivatives market and turned to bet in lower petroleum prices. 
Insofar as the American economy is concerned, the last Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting kept the base interest rate (Fed funds) at 6.5% p.a., a decision supported by still persistent inflationary risks, though lessened by a sluggish economic activity. The FOMC explanations of its decision strengthened expectations on future interest rate drops, as evidenced by futures interest rate contracts. 
The signs of recovery in the Japanese economy are still weak. The estimated GDP for the third quarter increased 1% as against the previous quarter, and 1.5% when compared to the same period of 1999. Household expenditures do not display a clear trend, and net exports lost strength in the third quarter.
Regarding the Euro Zone countries, economic activity keeps indicating deceleration while inflation keeps its upward trend, reflecting increased import prices, mainly of petroleum. The European Central Bank kept unchanged in 4.75% p.a. the interest rate on main refinancing operations. In the exchange market, after three European Central Bank interventions in the first half of November, the Euro appreciated in the second half of the month and reached, in the first week of December, its higher price against the United States Dollar over the past three months.
In Argentina, domestic demand remained weak. The confidence crisis of the past months increased the sovereign risk premium and domestic interest rates. In response, the Government adopted two sets of economic measures. The first, in October, aimed at encouraging investment and consumption, favoring, in consequence, fiscal revenue and employment. The measures taken in November were turned towards the necessary structural reforms in labor and social security legislation. The pact agreed between the central Government and those of the Provinces, coupled with approval of the 2001 budget, enabled the completion of the IMF financial assistance agreement. Under the agreement, the country was granted access to funds estimated in US$ 39.7 billion, sufficient to secure foreign funding over the next year, restore the necessary confidence climate and attract the investments needed to recover the country’s economy.
The higher price indices in November reflected the partial effects of fuel price readjustment, effective as from the 23rd, while agricultural prices displayed a negative change over the month.  
The Broad Consumer Price Index (IPCA) turned in growth of 0.32% in November, with accumulated expansion of 5.35% in the year and 5.99% in the last 12 months. The 0.18 percentage point increase in the monthly change of the index resulted from a 0.43% rise in non-food products, softened by a drop of 0.07% in the food and beverage group. The rise in price of non-food products was restricted to some products only, with emphasis to gasoline and electric energy, which contributed with 0.21 percentage point to the total index change. In the case of electric energy, the increase resulted from rate adjustments in Rio de Janeiro and Porto Alegre.
IGP-DI rose 0.39% in November (0.37% in October), with equivalent changes in wholesale, consumer and construction prices. Regarding wholesale prices, it shall be mentioned a drop of 0.07% in agricultural prices, as against a rise of 0.8% in October. Insofar as IPC is concerned, the impact of gasoline, and that of electricity and urban bus price adjustments in Rio de Janeiro reached 0.41 percentage point. Similarly to IPCA, the food item, with a drop of 0.51%, softened the index variation. The IPC core increased 0.35%, aggregating 3.95% in the twelve months change. 
Identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed in light of newly available information. The scenario considered in the simulations is based on the following hypotheses: 
a. the November inflation (0.32%) was in keeping with the expected value (0.30%). For this reason and the estimate from 0.6% to 0.7% for the December inflation, the yearly rate of inflation shall be very close to the goal of 6%.
b. despite its volatility, the international petroleum price is falling both in spot and in futures markets. By the new adjustment mechanism for domestic fuel prices, establishing automatic quarterly changes based on the price of R$ 55.00 for the Brent, the price curve implicit in futures contracts implies a decrease of gasoline prices in 2001;
c. the average readjustment for the set of administered prices in 2001 shall reach 6%, for a direct contribution of 1.3 percentage point to the yearly inflation. This includes fuels and the 19.2% rise of the minimum salary next April, which will represent 0.62 percentage points in that month’s inflation.  
d. the increase of grain harvest in 2001 shall foster a smaller change in food prices when compared to the average of other prices in the year, with deflationary pressure in the second quarter. 
e. according to futures contract forecasts, the hypothesis for the path of fed funds rate includes two reductions of 25 basis points in the first quarter of 2001. Therefore, the rate would drop from the current 6.5% p.a. to 6% p.a., remaining stable at such level.
f. in the foreign sector, the normal deceleration of the U.S. economy tends to induce smaller world growth, of about 3%, a drop in petroleum prices and a less restrictive monetary policy in the United States. The combination of these factors may enable a better perception of the Brazil risk and promote international liquidity conditions in line with the need to finance the current transactions balance of payment deficit. Even though, the working hypothesis keeps being the one of maintaining the Brazil risk premium at its current level. All other hypothesis considered in the previous meeting were maintained, in special the one of attaining primary surplus according to the fiscal policy goals and GDP growth in line with balanced aggregate demand and supply.
Based on simulation exercises with the basic (structural) model scenario, one reached the conclusion that maintaining the interest rate at the current level of 16.5% enables complying with the inflation goal with ease in 2001 and 2002. 
The IPCA core inflation, calculated by the method of rounded averages, dropped to 0.32% in November, from 0.42% in October, confirming the downturn of the last two months and suggesting levels of monthly inflation in line with the 2001 goal. However, the core inflation measured by IPC-BR, published by the Getúlio Vargas Foundation, had an opposing behavior, increasing from 0.21% to 0.36%, though close to the monthly average of 0.28% measured in the first half of the year. 
The median of expectations for IPCA changes collected by a daily Central Bank survey was 6.07% for 2000 and 4.30% for 2001. The stable inflation expectations over the past months, a period when the Real loss strength before the Dollar, confirms a perception that the effect of exchange variations on domestic prices is limited and that its magnitude seems to be diminishing. 
Between November 22 and December 19, the monetary effect of definite operations with Central Bank securities was contractive in R$ 2.7 billion. These operations were in keeping with the objective of fully rolling the maturing exchange security debt, considering final interest and the nominal updated redemption value. 
The definite operations with LTN were expansionary in R$ 4.5 billion. The eight sales added up to R$ 5.2 billion, contrasting with R$ 9.7 billion in redemptions, computing, in this amount, R$ 1.0 billion of previous sales. Six-months and one-year LTN both displayed maximum interest rates at the opening in November 28, and retreated systematically over the following days.
The four LFT offers totaled R$ 6.9 billion, while redemptions added up to R$ 9.9 billion. One should also consider the renewed offer of five-year NTN-C in two steps on November 29 and 30 with a total value of R$ 0.3 billion. Only 15% of this amount was liquidated with the use of securitized credits for which the National Treasury was liable.
Taken together, definite operations with federal public securities indicated a monetary expansion of R$ 8.0 billion. This excess liquidity was partially offset by payment, to the Sole Account, of amounts related to privatization of Banespa and increased selling position of securities, from the Central Bank, in its committed operations.
Analysis of supply and demand conditions reveals no significant pressures on inflation. Indicators of aggregate demand display expressive growth over the year, a trend reinforced by preliminary data on the fourth quarter. With this, in the year 2000, the beginning of a more vigorous and sustainable period of growth is consolidated. The increased aggregate demand is driven by higher exports of manufactures and growth in the consumption of durable goods.
Investment indicators, in turn, fail to display expressive growth in 2000. However, an itemized analysis of these indicators indicate that this performance is mainly due to the stagnation of the relatively highly-weighted construction industry. This means that the higher contribution to investment comes from sectors concerned with increasing production and installed capacity, helping diminishing potential unbalances between supply and demand, with effects on prices.
Regarding fiscal policy, the goals established for the consolidated public sector primary result keep being permanently and consistently achieved, building a fundamental buttress of economic stability. The continued fiscal effort, reflected in the goals established for the subsequent years, is playing a relevant role in strengthening the confidence of agents in the set of public policies, in particular, adding more freedom to conduction of the monetary policy and contributing to curb inflation. 
Aggregate supply indicators point to a growth throughout the year, with upturns under average utilization of installed output capacity, employment and industrial productivity.
In the external sector, recent developments have been positive, though the main uncertainties are far from vanishing. Petroleum prices started a sharp decline, in both the spot and the futures market, suggesting the closing of a two-year cycle in which this commodity was responsible for the main foreign shock affecting the Brazilian economy. The U.S. economy seems to confirm lower growth, although there are doubts on how smooth this process will be. Given the strong fiscal conditions and the careful monitoring history of the U.S. monetary authority, the slowdown tends to be moderate.
These two factors contribute towards a reduction in the growth level of the world economy to about 3% in 2001, resulting in an environment of diminishing inflation, making room for a gradually softer monetary policy in the main industrialized countries. This less strict monetary policy, in a context of soft slowdown, in case it comes to be confirmed, tends to favor international liquidity. Perception of sovereign risk shall also gradually improve in line with the perception that the Brazilian economy fundamentals are solid is consolidated. Still regarding the foreign sector, among the uncertainties that were mitigated, the ones related to the foreign funding of Argentina may be included. The recent agreement reached with international banks and organizations improved the funding profile and opened avenues to resume the country’s growth in the next year.
The recent behavior of inflation confirms Copom’s perception of a low degree of inertia built into the process of domestic price formation. Inflation rate measured by IPCA shall be very close to the goal of 6% at the end of 2000, for a reduction of almost three percentage points as against the previous year. This reduction happened despite a strong influence of administered prices, which increased 12% in the year, and exchange devaluation of 9.5% (more recent value compared to the one at the end of 1999), which had a relatively weak  impact on domestic prices. The stability of inflation expectations along the year ratifies the ability of the economy to absorb shocks without excessive welfare costs. 
An analysis of the domestic and foreign macroeconomic scenario, including all potential risks associated, leads to a conclusion that the perspectives for 2001 favor a decline in inflation in about two percentage points when compared to the current year, as required by the inflation goal established in 1999. One may list, as main causes: an expected drop in gasoline prices, a result of declining petroleum international prices; an increase of about 6% in the set of administered prices, about half of the percentage for 2000; a substantial agricultural harvest increase; the stable expectations of market agents; and the lack of pressures on prices in the economy.  
"
21/02/2001;55;Arminio Fraga;"The economic activity sustained a stable growth rate along the second half-year, in spite of the higher base of comparison in equal period of 1999. Despite substantial expansion of aggregate demand, there were no inflationary pressures. 
According to the National Confederation of Industry (CNI) and Federation of Industries of the State of São Paulo (FIESP) data, seasonally adjusted industrial sales increased 2.5% and 0.8% in November, aggregating growths of 10.7% and 13.4%, respectively, on the first eleven months of the year. Following a similar trend, industrial sales of vehicles increased 23.8% in 2000, with expansions of 33.9% in exports and 21.2% in domestic sales. 
According to preliminary statistics released by the Trade Federation of the State of São Paulo (FCESP), in December real sales of the retail sector, deflated by IPCA, grew 5.8% in seasonally adjusted data as against the previous month. Over the year, retail sales aggregated an expansion of 11.6%. This growth was driven by sales of non-durables (increase of 15.8%), vehicles (14.9%) and durables (14.8%), contrasting to a substantial drop (34.1%) in sales of semi-durables. 
Aggregate demand followed these increased sales. The indicators reveal a positive behavior for industrial production, coupled with a trend of continued employment expansion and gradual recovery of real salaries. 
Industrial production increased 6.4% in November, with emphasis for the categories of durable consumables and capital goods, with growths of 19% and 13%, respectively.
The labor market in November displayed a growth in formal employment for the fourteenth consecutive month. As a whole, all activity sectors indicate increase in occupation, with the exception of construction industry. The rate of open unemployment, measured in six metropolitan regions, reduced to 6.19% in November, from 6.75% in October. 
The level of installed capacity utilization in the manufacturing industry, calculated by CNI, reached 82% in November, the higher level ever recorded by this series.
This increased level of utilization stimulated the demand for investments. Production of capital goods expanded 13% in the year up to November, and imports of capital goods, though experiencing a drop of 5.5% in the year up to November, exhibited a reversal of this trend (up to July the drop aggregated 13.6%). Loans granted by BNDES increased 27.7% in the year. In contrast, production of construction industry inputs increased just 2.2% from January to November 2000, as against the same period of 1999. However, a recovery of this sector can be observed in the last months of the year, with growths of 1.6% in October and 0.6% in November.
An increased aggregate demand, including exports, and larger fuel expenditures have impacted the trade balance, which recorded a negative balance of US$ 213 million in December, for an aggregate deficit of US$ 698 million in the year. There was a significant increase in exports over the month, a result of the high in sales of manufactures, with a daily average 23.5% above that of December 1999. In turn, the daily average of imports increased 25.9%, reflecting growths in all product categories. As against November, the daily average of imports reduced as a result of lower expenditures in fuels and lubricants, raw materials and consumption goods. 
Imports of intermediary goods recorded a growth in 2000, in keeping with expanded exports of manufactures and domestic demand. In December, the main imports were those of naphthas, fertilizers, chemical products, electronic components, iron and steel products, papers and plastic resins. Expenditures with fuels were impacted by higher international petroleum prices. However, imports of petroleum diminished 8.1% in December, as against the same month in the previous year, explained by the downturn of 34.3% in the volume imported. 
In December, international petroleum prices experienced a substantial decline, with the Brent ending the month at US$ 22.6/barrel. This downwards trend was interrupted in January, in response to expectations of production cuts by OPEC country members. However, the actual price is still about 10% below the average price recorded in the last year.
Recent demand and supply indicators in the United States support the expectations of deceleration in the economy. Retail sales, new buildings and orders to manufacturers, when analyzed according to the twelve-month change, show a declining path. Consumer credit, that was displaying growing rates until October, recorded stability in November.
The deceleration trend failed to reflect in aggregate labor market statistics up to this moment. The unemployment rate was 4% in December, stable as against November, and the average nominal income for hour worked increased 0.4% in this same month. However, the increase in industrial employment in December was significantly lower that the yearly average. The inflation rate remained under control, and the producer price index (PPI) was stable in December, for a growth of 3.6% in 12 months. The consumer price index changed 0.2%, aggregating a growth of 3.4% over the year. With the exclusion of food and energy, the change of the PPI core reached 1.2% in the year, and that of CPI, 2.6%.
On January 3, the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC) announced a reduction on the target for the base interest rate (fed funds) to 6.0%, from 6.5%. In the same week, the rediscount rate was reduced to 5.5%, from 6.0% p.a., in two stages.
In Japan, the signs of economic recovery kept feeble, with weakened consumption, decelerated trend in industrial growth and drop in monthly trade balances. In this environment, the unemployment rate increased to 4.8% in November, from 4.7% in October. Consumer prices reduced 0.5% in the twelve months up to November, while in the same period the change in wholesale prices was 0.3%. 
Regarding the countries in the Euro area, the growth trend shows some evidence of deceleration. Retail sales sustained positive, though decreasing, rates when compared to those of the same period of the previous year. Performance has been uneven among associated countries, with an expressive consumption increase in France YLV_j_YLV a milder expansion in Germany. The twelve-month aggregate trade surplus diminished to US$ 15.9 in October, from US$ 20.1 billion in September. Industrial production increased 0.5% in November, aggregating a growth of 3.8% over the year, while the unemployment rate remained stable at 8.8% in the same month. Inflationary pressures tend to weaken with the reduced petroleum prices and the recent appreciation of the Euro. In the twelve-month period up to November, the harmonized consumer price index changed 2.9% and prices to producer increased 6.3%.
In Argentina, a renewed confidence climate reduced the spread between Peso and Dollar operations to 1% in mid-January, from 3.9% at the end of November, for thirty-day operations. The domestic interest rates receded due to the announced accord with the International Monetary Fund in December, reflecting, in addition, the drop of interest rates in the United States. Economic activity level indicators failed to catch the upturn in growth, a fact that, coupled with the increased petroleum prices, contributed towards a trade surplus of US$ 600 million over the twelve-month period up to November.
Regarding general price indices, the December increase was led by wholesale prices, especially industrial products, resulting from the impact of readjusted fuel and lubricant prices (6.1%). Regarding consumer prices, the increase was pulled by administered prices, including electricity prices and urban bus fares in Rio de Janeiro, alcohol and higher gasoline prices at the end of November.
IGP-DI elevated 0.76% in December, as against a growth of 0.39% in November. Among its components, there were changes of 0.85% in wholesale price index, 0.62% in consumer price, and 0.64% in cost of construction indices. Industrial wholesale prices recorded an advance of 1.15%, while that of farm prices changed 0.17%, after a reduction of 0.07% in November. The aggregated IGP-DI increase in 2000 reached 9.81%, while that of IPA-DI and IPC accumulated changes of 12.06% and of 6.21%, respectively.
 IPCA displayed a change of 0.59% in December, as against 0.32% in November. The index was pressed by administered prices, with a growth of 2.09%, with emphasis for adjustments in water and sewer, energy, bottled gas, alcohol and gasoline. The group food and beverages recorded a negative change of 0.48%, before a drop of 0.07% in November. Over the year, IPCA aggregated a change of 5.97%, fulfilling the 6% target established by the Government.
Identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed in light of newly available information. The scenario considered in the simulations is based on the following hypotheses: 
a. the December inflation (0.59%) was slightly below what was expected (0.65%), which secured compliance with the 6% target (5.97%) , 
b. an expected 5% petroleum production cut by countries member of OPEC (meeting of 01.17) is unlikely to cause unrest in international petroleum prices. Under the new fuel domestic price adjustment mechanism, that sets automatic quarterly changes based on the price of R$ 55.00 for the Brent barrel, and considering the implicit price schedule of futures petroleum contracts, we forecast a 6.5 % drop in gasoline prices for the consumer (corresponding to a drop of 8.65% in refinery prices) in the second quarter of 2001, being the occurrence of additional reductions during the rest of the year likely. 
c. the average price adjustment for administered prices shall reach 6% in 2001. this includes fuels and a minimum wage increase to R$ 180 in April.
d. according to futures contracts forecasts, the hypothesis for the path of fed funds rate includes two reductions of 50 basis points in the first half of 2001. Therefore, the rate would drop from the current 6% p.a. to 5.0% p.a., remaining stable at such level. 
e. in the foreign environment, the Federal Reserve decision to cut off 50 basis points in the interest rates, although evidencing the risk of a stronger deceleration, shows resoluteness of the monetary authority to act in a timely way in order to avoid brisk movements that would affect the world economy. A stronger deceleration in the United States economy tends to generate a more favorable trend for interest rates and petroleum prices. Depending on the magnitude of such effects, the risks to the Brazilian economy stemming from future developments of the United States economy may offset each other. Given this fact and a favorable perception on the Brazilian economic fundamentals, a stable Brazil risk premium   was taken as working hypothesis, after the slight improvements occurred since the last meeting are taken into account.
All other hypothesis considered in the previous meeting were maintained, in special the one of attaining primary surplus according to the fiscal policy goals and GDP growth in line with balanced aggregate demand and supply. 
Simulation exercises with the scenario considered in the basic (structural) model suggest that maintaining the interest rate at the current level of 15.75% p.a. (effective until January 17) enables the fulfillment of the 2001 and 2002 inflation targets. This last conclusion holds when one uses the nominal interest path expected by the market (14% p.a. at the end of 2001), recorded by the monthly survey performed by the Central Bank. 
The IPCA core inflation, calculated by the method of rounded averages, kept practically stable at 0.33% in December (0.32% in November) , suggesting levels of monthly inflation in line with the 2001 goal. However, the core inflation measured by IPC-BR published by the Getúlio Vargas Foundation increased from 0.36% to 0.50%, well above the monthly average of 0.28% measured in the first half of the year. IPCA core inflation indicators, using the method of exclusion (i.e., excluding administered prices and foodstuffs) indicate rates in keeping with the compliance of targets.
The median of expectations for IPCA changes, collected by a Central Bank daily survey, was 4.20% for 2001, below the level of 4.3% observed in the last COPOM meeting. For 2002, the median of expectations is 3.82%. 
In the period from December 19 and January 15, the Central Bank fully rolled the maturing exchange securities, including updated principal and final interests. With this purpose, two auctions were held of NBC-E, totaling R$ 4.1 billion.
It shall be stressed that, along the past two years, there was increased exposure of the Central Bank in exchange securities and, simultaneously, a reduction of the National Treasury exposure. A slight downwards trend was observed in the aggregate of both issuers.   
The National Treasury held in the period three public offers of LTN, with two maturity alternatives in each case: in the first and second offers, six or twelve months , in the third, terms of twelve or eighteen months. Sales reached R$ 7.4 billion which compares to scheduled redemptions of R$ 4.8 billion and anticipated redemptions of R$ 1.9 billion, resulting from a single public offer to purchase. The average rate of LTN placements displayed a systematic drop for all terms. In the specific case of eighteen months LTN, the average rate reached 16.47% p.a. Three LTN public offers were made with a term of four years, totaling R$ 5.4 billion as against a redemption of R$ 10.3 billion. This total redemption includes R$ 4.2 billion corresponding to the LFT-B used in paying NTN-C. The average discount in all auctions was 0.10% p.a.
Regarding the National Treasury domestic securities debt management policy, a deepening can be observed in the process of restructuring, the main results of which are: (1) increased issues of predetermined yield debt, in which yields are linked to price indices, contrasting to net redemptions of debt with yield linked to the Selic rate , and (2) extended terms of new issues. 
The first offer of thirty years NTN-C deserves mention, held in two phases on December 27 and 28. The sale reached R$ 4.8 billion, fully settled by the use of CFT-A and LFT-B. It is noticeable that the demand for such securities had reached R$ 14.8 billion, evidencing a demand for much longer terms and an expansion of the horizon of analysis enabled by expectations of a long-lasting stability.
In the period, the monetary impact of definite operations with federal public securities was null. This way, contrasting to what had happened in recent times, the net redemption of competitive debt was not significant. 
Available aggregate demand indicators show a consumption demand practically at the same level along the second half of 2000. The demand for investment, on the other hand, is   displaying signs of recovery in the second half of the year. The targets set for fiscal policy are being consistently attained since the end of 1998. The increase in exports, although not sufficient to secure surplus in the trade balance, had been an important factor for the growth of aggregate demand. Summarizing, the aggregate demand is adequate, with its composition indicating recovery of investment levels. Such investments are not higher because of a sluggish recovery in the building industry that, notwithstanding this, is showing a positive reaction along recent months. 
Aggregate supply displays favorable behavior, with industrial production expanding over 6% up to November 2000. The perspectives for the 2000/2001 agricultural harvest are positive, with forecasts of a high in grain production. The labor market keeps its expansion trend, without displaying imbalances that may suggest pressures from the costs side of the economy. Formal employment increased for the fourteenth consecutive month in November, and the unemployment rate reduced to about 6.2% over the same period.
Summarizing, the supply and demand balance fails to suggest any pressure on price indices over the horizon relevant to the inflationary targets regime. However, the steady economic growth has impacted the trade balance. Particularly, as already stressed by this Committee, the expanded level of activity is pulling the imports of intermediary goods and, in the second half of 2000, came to significantly affect the imports of consumer goods. This behavioral trend of the trade balance has, as its counterpart, a perspective of lower international petroleum prices and global conditions for the balance of payment funding, confirmed by recent placement of securities by the Republic totaling US$ 2.5 billion and improved assessments of the Brazil risk.
The foreign environment prevalent in the beginning of this year is positive, in spite of some ongoing uncertainties. The recent behavior of international petroleum prices, despite the production cuts announced by OPEC, suggests a weakening of the upward price trend started two years ago. In Argentina, a new wave of confidence made possible a reduction in domestic interest rates and spread between operations in pesos and American dollars in this beginning of year. In the United States economy, a reduction in the rhythm of growth is being confirmed. However, the intensity of this deceleration remains uncertain. The recent softening of the United States monetary policy, although being an evidence of a stronger   _ deceleration risk, demonstrates the resoluteness of the monetary authority in avoiding brisk movements that would affect the whole world economy. Therefore, the risks for the Brazilian economy stemming from future developments in the United States seem to be balanced, despite depending on the magnitude of different effects. A stronger deceleration jeopardizes our foreign financing and exports and, consequently, our perspectives of growth, while tending to generate lower interest rates in the United States and a more favorable path for international petroleum prices, thus favoring lower inflation. 
The recent behavior of inflation is in keeping with COPOM perceptions. The inflation in December, measured by IPCA, was 0.59%, within the expectations of this Committee. With this result, we end the year 2000 complying with the 6% target set by the Government. The 2001 market expectations regarding inflation experienced a slight drop since the last COPOM meeting, and are in line with the inflation target for the next two years. The recent inflation results, as well as the stable market expectations regarding the future behavior of inflation, confirm the Committee perception that domestic prices have already incorporated, to a large extent, the depreciation experienced by the Real in the last quarter of 2000 
Considering this analysis of the macroeconomic domestic and foreign environment in this beginning of year and the main risks associated with it, a conclusion was reached that the perspectives for 2001 and 2002 are in keeping with the declined inflation required by the inflation targets set.
"
28/03/2001;56;Arminio Fraga;"By the end of the last year, indicators of aggregate supply displayed a strong expansion, with increased average utilization of installed capacity and expansion of industrial employment. IBGE published the 2000 GDP figures, exhibiting a growth of 4.2%, led by a 4.8% industrial product expansion, with emphasis to the manufacturing industry. Farm products and services exhibited a positive though less intense evolution, of 2.9% and 3.6%, respectively. It shall be stressed that IBGE rectified the third quarter results, whose growth changed to 4.1%, from 3.8%. 
In December, industrial production grew 7.2% as against November considering the seasonally adjusted series. The production growth in December was generalized, reaching 14 of the 20 branches surveyed and all use categories. Regarding use categories, consumer durables exhibited the higher growth (23%). Over the year, industrial production aggregated an expansion of 6.5%.
Insofar as the labor market is concerned, employment and productivity kept their increasing trend. The open unemployment rate diminished to 6.0% in December, from 6.8% in November, in the seasonally adjusted series, reflecting mainly a diminished number of the Active Working Population (PEA). All economic activity sectors exhibited a unemployment reduction in December. Data on labor productivity growth, available up to October, exhibited an aggregated growth in the year of 6%. 
The level of installed capacity utilization reached 82% in January, after having arrived to 84.1% in October 2000, according to the Manufacturing Industry Short-Term Survey held by the Getúlio Vargas Foundation. Disregarding seasonal influences, the measured growth was 0.6%. The level of January, even exceeding that of January 2000 (81%), is well below the high of 86% occurred in April 1995. 
Broken down by activity sectors, the level of 77% reached by consumer good industries kept below the average for this month and the high of 87% recorded in October 1995. In the same way, for capital good industries the level of January (81%) was lower than that of the industry average and below the peak of 86% reached in October 1997. Out of the 23 industrial sectors surveyed, nine of them exhibited a capacity utilization below 80%, with emphasis to pharmaceuticals, 64.4%, transportation materials, 77.4%, and mechanics, 75.5%. The textile industry was the only displaying a high of capacity utilization in January (91%). It shall be noticed that in some industrial sectors, as paper and cardboard and rubber, an intense utilization of installed capacity is a behavior typical of such industries. 
The expansionist rhythm was kept in this beginning of year, evidenced by higher aggregate demand, a trend sustained by credit expansion and improved consumer expectations, given the favorable results of main macroeconomic indicators.
Industrial sales of automotive vehicles increased 28.1% in January as against the same month of the previous year, exhibiting an expansion of 29.1% in the domestic market and 23.5% in exports. 
According to the Trade Federation of the State of São Paulo (FCESP) preliminary data, real retail sales in the metropolitan region increased 1.3% in January as against the previous month, and 16.3% in the comparison with January 2000, in the seasonally adjusted series. Sales of consumer durables and non-durables led the expansion, driven by better credit conditions.
Indeed, according to a preliminary survey related to January, the balance of free fund credits increased 1.9% in the month, a result from a drop of 0.2% in credits channeled to juristic persons and increase of 6.3% in those channeled to natural persons. This result indicates a continued contribution of credit operations in support of aggregate demand. Total credit in the economy, including free and earmarked funds, reached R$ 315.9 billion (28.7% of GDP), for a drop of 0.4% in the month. 
Despite the credit growth, defaults in the banking system kept moderate. Credits with payment at maturity corresponded to 92.8% of the total in January this year, and those above 90 days late reached 3.1%. In contrast, commerce recorded a possibly transitory increase in the net rate of default, which in São Paulo reached 9.3% in January, as against 4.2% in December, according to the Credit Protection Service of the São Paulo Trade Association. The share of checks returned for insufficient funds on the total checks cleared also increased in January to 4.2%, following the 3.5% recorded in December. 
The strong growth of aggregate demand encouraged investments. Investment indicators kept expanding, with emphasis to the production of capital goods, which increased 12.7% in 2000, especially those related to serially industrialized goods and those channeled to agriculture and transports. Capital good imports increased 6.8% in December and 33.1% in January in the seasonally adjusted series. Increased BNDES disbursements to the productive sector of 57.1% in January 2000, as against the same month of 2000, are worth mentioning. 
Construction industry, with an expressive weight in investments and GDP estimates, exhibited a less dynamic performance over the last year, as shown by a yearly expansion of 2% in the production of inputs. However, production of capital goods for construction increased 15% in 2000, and the level of activity has been recovering over the past months. Unemployment rate in the sector came to 5.7% in December, from 7.5% in November (observed data), and sales of construction materials in January increased 24.3% as against the same month of the previous year. 
The increase in aggregate demand has been partially met by goods produced abroad. In January, the trade balance resulted in a deficit of US$ 479 million, partially offset by a surplus of US$ 17 million in the first two weeks of February. Imports experienced a generalized increase, with emphasis to capital goods (+54.3%) and raw materials and intermediate goods (+29.0%). International trade experienced a noticeable increase in volume. In January, the trade balance recorded average daily exports of US$ 206.3 million and imports of US$ 228 million, increasing 25.5% and 34.2%, respectively, as against the same month of 2000. Main increases were observed in the exports of primary products, such as soybean, iron ore, cellulose and sugar, reflecting a continued expansion in volumes shipped. Over the two first weeks of February, daily averages experienced an increase of 6.1% for exports and 6.9% for imports, as against February 2000.
Part of the trade balance deficit in January is likely to result from temporary factors. Imports of fuels and lubricants in January were 14.9% above the monthly average of 2000. In turn, the higher purchases of capital goods in January may be associated not only to the increase in industrial product but also, starting on that month, to a reduction to 14% of the import duty, from 18% (this category’s Mercosul Common Foreign Duty), and extension of the offduty schedule, which established in 4% the import duty for 1,584 items, mainly those related to sectors such as chemical, petrochemical, paper and cellulose, textile, vehicle manufacturing and vehicle parts and spares. Such items, added to 384 computer and telecommunication items also included in the off-duty schedule, were responsible by around 8% of capital goods imports up to September 2000.
The growth in production of industrialized countries is likely to decelerate this year, led by a slowing down of the United States growth to a range of 1.75% to 2.5%, according to current market expectations. In the United States, the NAPM index of purchase managers, related to the manufacturing industry, reached 41.2% in January, the lowest level in the past two years. Industrial production in the seasonally adjusted series reduced 0.6% in December, as against the previous month. In turn, unemployment rate increased to 4.2% in January, from 4.0% in December.
In its January meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee decided in favor of a new drop of 50 basis points in the base interest rate target, reduced to 5.5% p.a. The Committee’s communiqué referred to the need of a swift and firm response to be given by monetary policy in an environment of stronger reduction in consumer and company confidence, which is already affecting industrial production. On that same date, the rediscount rate was reduced in 50 basis points, to 5% p.a. 
Regarding the countries in the Euro Area, one expects a growth between 2.3% and 2.8% in 2001, probably above the one to be experienced by the United States. In December, unemployment rate remained stable at 8.7%. Industrial production increased 0.6% in November, aggregating a yearly expansion of 4.7%. Inflation, measured by the harmonized consumer price index, reached 2.6% in 2000, exhibiting a decline as against the yearly 2.9% recorded up to November. However, confidence indicators kept the downward trend started in September 2000. 
In Japan, consumption remains weak while investment indicators display some reaction: industrial orders increased 15.4% in November, as against the same month of the previous year, and starts of housing buildings increased 10.6% in December as against December 1999. The trade balance aggregated in twelve months recorded a drop of 4.4% in December, keeping a downward trend, while the unemployment rate remained at 4.8% over the last two months of 2000. Industrial production recorded an increase of 5.2% over the year.  
Petroleum international price keeps volatile. Prices in the demand market were higher in the first weeks of February, yet futures markets exhibit expectations of lower prices along the year. 
Finally, Argentina is recovering the agent’s confidence in the country, as suggested by the performance of interest rates and cost of Treasury securities placements held since the beginning of the year. In this line, the difference between interests in thirty days operations in Dollars and Pesos was 0.375% on February 13, with rates reaching 6.875% p.a. and 7.25% p.a., respectively, levels below those in effect before the crisis. 
IPCA recorded an increase of 0.57% in January, as against 0.59% in December. A reduction in the fuel variation rate, that had a significant impact in December, was offset by an increase in foodstuffs and school fees, both of seasonal character. Important also were pressures stemming from price adjustments in urban bus fares of some capital cities, higher electricity prices, and incidence of ICMS on energy, in Belém. With the January result, the IPCA change over the past twelve months reached 5.92%. 
The General Price Index – Internal Supply (IGP-DI) turned in growth of 0.49% in January, because of a change of 0.40% in the wholesale price index, 0.64% in the consumer price index and 0.58% in the cost of construction index. In the wholesale, emphasis shall be given to the drop of 0.62% in prices of agricultural products, resulting mainly from a reduction of 2.9% in prices of animals and by-products, especially birds. The change in industrial prices reduced to 0.78% in January, from 1.15% in December. Regarding IPC, the increase was mainly due to items such as education, foodstuffs and miscellaneous expenses, in addition to the contribution given by urban bus fares in some capital cities. The IPC core increased 0.44%, as against 0.50% in December
The period from January 17 to February 13 was marked by a contractive monetary impact (of R$ 1.8 billion in definite operations with federal securities) and an extension of terms.
In four traditional public offers, the National Treasury sold LTNs maturing in twelve and eighteen months. Yet, in a single firm offer auction, twenty-six months LTNs were sold, the most extended term for securities of this type. The financial volume of such placements reached R$ 10.4 billion, against redemptions of R$ 10.2 billion, considering R$ 2.5 billion resulting from two purchase auctions.
The Central Bank performed in the period a full rollover of exchange securities updated principal to mature, by means of three NBC-Es auctions with maturities of two, three and four years, respectively. The result of such events makes evident that economic agents are demanding exchange hedge for longer terms.
In addition, four competitive offers of LFTs took place in the period, the first with a term of four years and the remaining three with five-year terms. Even with the extended terms, a systematic discount reduction was recorded, from 0.09% to 0.04% p.a., from the first to the last auction.
Still regarding the primary market, and ratifying the trend of larger terms, the National Treasury held the second offer of thirty-year NTN-C. Sales totaled R$ 2.5 billion, of which 52% of the total amount was settled with the use of securitized credits of National Treasury responsibility and LFT-B. 
Identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed in light of newly available information. The scenario considered in the simulations is based on the following hypotheses: 
a. inflation measured in January (0.57%) was slightly above the expected value (0.50%),
b. the price schedule currently implicit in futures Brent petroleum contracts displaced about US$ 2.00 up, as against the one observed in the previous COPOM meeting. With this, and the current market exchange rate level, the 6.5% drop previously expected for gasoline prices to consumers in the second quarter may not occur, but instead just smaller reductions over the last two quarters of 2001. 
c. electric energy prices were reassessed in the light of authorizations already granted by ANEEL this year. Total adjustments of electric energy in 2001 came to 15.8%, from 12%, with higher increases in the two last quarters. Regarding the set of administered prices, including fuels and minimum salary, the expected average adjustment reaches 8.5%, with a direct contribution to this year’s inflation of 1.9 percentage point,
d. according to futures contract forecasts, the hypothesis for the path of fed funds rate includes an additional reduction of 50 basis points in the second quarter of 2001. Therefore, the rate would drop from the current 5.5% p.a. to 5% p.a., remaining stable at such level, 
e. other hypothesis considered at the previous meeting was maintained, namely the calling for a primary surplus based on the targets defined by fiscal policy. This hypothesis, coupled with lower interest rates in the United States, drop of petroleum prices and an appreciation of the Euro before the Dollar, may enable a gradually improved perception of the Brazil risk 
The GDP growth was adjusted according to data published by IBGE. Simulation exercises with the scenario considered in the basic model (structural) enable the conclusion that maintaining the interest rate at its current level of 15.25% p.a. permits fulfilling the inflation targets for 2001 and 2002. When based on the path of market-expected nominal interest rates (expressed in the monthly survey held by the Central Bank), which reaches 13.8% p.a. at the end of 2001, inflation forecasts become slightly above the 2001 target, though keeping comfortably within the ±2% margin.  
The IPCA core inflation, calculated by the method of rounded averages, was back to the level of 0.42% in January, after remaining at about 0.33% in the two previous months. However, the majority of excluded items, for being in the upper tail of the distribution, belong to food in the household and education. The increases observed in such items are typically temporary, that is to say, not likely to repeat in the next months. This analysis is corroborated by the IPCA cores calculated by exclusion. Once the influence of administered prices is removed, the cumulative IPCA change over the past twelve months dropped to 3.2% in January, and keeps the downward trend started in September. In turn, the core of inflation measured by IPC-BR, published by the Getúlio Vargas Foundation, dropped to 0.44%, from 0.50%, following the same declining pattern observed in the same period of 2000.
The IPCA change expectation median, collected by a daily survey performed by the Central Bank, kept in 4.20% for 2001, yet reduced from 3.82% to 3.75% in 2002. 
Available aggregate demand indicators keep exhibiting a balanced growth among their different components. Consumption demand keeps steady, supported by credit expansion and improved expectations. Investment demand, that had being channeled to durable goods, gives signs of turning also towards the construction industry, judging by the increase in demand for capital goods and other inputs of such industry. Public sector consumption keeps stable, with a consistent fulfillment of the targets set to the fiscal policy. The faster rhythm of exports is in keeping with expectations for this time of the year, though still insufficient to reach a trade balance surplus, given the fast pace of imports, mainly those related to intermediary and capital goods. 
Aggregate supply is following the rhythm of increased demand. Industrial production keeps vigorous, reflecting an increased utilization of installed capacity, though failing to imply detectable hindrances to the maintenance of growth in an environment of price stability. Perspectives for the 2000/2001 agricultural harvest remain positive, with a high in grain production forecasts, though for some crops, such as rice and beans, estimates have been  revised downwards. The labor market exhibits improvements, with smaller unemployment rates and without unbalances that may imply pressures from the cost side.
Summarizing, the supply and demand balance fails to suggest any pressure on price indices over the horizon relevant to the inflationary targets regime. However, a firm economic growth has affected the trade balance, the aggregate result of which is declining since the last third of 2000, affecting expectations of the exchange market. In contrast, conditions for the trade balance financing keep favorable and the Brazil risk evaluation abroad keeps improving, given the quality of domestic fundamentals and despite a reduction in the flow of direct investments forecasted for this year. 
The prevalent foreign environment exhibits relevant ongoing uncertainties. The recent behavior of petroleum international prices, after the production cut by the OPEC member countries, resumed a significant volatility. The pace in which petroleum international prices are dropping has been lower than the one forecasted by futures markets. Since the domestic petroleum by-products price adjustment arrangement for 2001 is directly linked to international prices, and since such by-products have significant weight in IPCA, this foreign price volatility make domestic inflation estimates imprecise. Regarding the world economy, perspectives of lower growth in industrialized countries seems to be ratified, given a deceleration in the rhythm of activity in the United States, as shown by recent statistics. As expected by the markets, these perspectives have led to a milder monetary policy in the United States with the aim of avoiding undesirable brisk moves. 
The recent behavior of inflation is in keeping with COPOM perceptions. However, for the third consecutive year, the change of administered prices, in whose formation inertial components are predominant, shall largely exceed the value of the inflation target for this year. Readjustments in electrical energy prices granted at the beginning of this year to regions not included in IPCA, for instance, were above the aggregate inflation measured by general price indices in the twelve previous months. Another important price is that of fuels, which shall change on a quarterly basis according to the average petroleum price and the exchange rate. Considered these factors, administered prices contribute with about half of the  value of the 2001 target. Market expectations for inflation in 2001 and 2002 keep practically unchanged since the last COPOM meeting, in keeping with the targets for these two years.

29/03/2001;57;Arminio Fraga;"In the beginning of 2001, indicators of the level of economic activity continued signaling robust expansion. Demand for consumption expanded both at wholesale and at retail levels, as evidenced by industry sales, including specific segments as auto vehicles, and by retail sales in the metropolitan region of São Paulo. Pointing in the same direction, the expansion of 9.6% in the number of credit card transactions, in the first two months of the year, compared to the same period in 2000, and the expansion related to the growth of the number of cleared checks, 1.5% in the same period. 
Contributed to the growth in consumption, the reduction in interest rates, stimulated by cuts in the Selic rate, as well as the growth in the level of employment, evidenced by the reduction in the open unemployment rate and by the growth in rates of formal employment. Noteworthy, however, that although that movement favors the increase of the total wage bill, it occurs in a moderate pace.  
The reduction in interest rates, combined with better conditions in employment and income, has contributed to the maintenance of the growth path of credit operations, of the financial system, expressed by the growth of 5.2% in credit volume carried out with free resources, in the first two months of the year. Of note, the increase of 9.7% in credit directed to individuals, while funds borrowed by companies registered an increase of 2.9%, responding to lower seasonal demand. Credit expansion has been followed incipiently by an increase in arrears in operations with individuals, which increased from 3.5% in January to 3.6% in February, considering credits in arrears for over 90 days. 
The credit expansion has stimulated, above all, sales of durable goods, segment in which the unitary value of goods is relatively higher, which makes their sales more susceptible to financing operations. 
The industrial production grew 6.5% in 2000, the best result since 1994, signaling a recovery in the sector, after two years of decline. In this context, the mining industry reached variation of 11.9%, resulting, mainly, from the growth of crude oil drilling and natural gas, and of the transformation industry, which responds for around 90% of total production, of 5.9%. 
The analysis of seasonally adjusted statistics reveals greater dynamics in the evolution of investment indicators, comparatively to those related to consumption. That behavior, to the extent that it reflects decisions towards augmenting productive capacity, indicates that economic agents expect sustainable and prolonged growth. 
Investment in January, exhibited positive overall evolution. With data released from seasonal influence, capital goods production grew 0.5% in January, and the production of inputs to construction, 2.1%, pushing these indicators to remain in a level significantly higher than the one registered in January 2000. 
The analysis of production of selected capital goods items indicates an accumulated variation of 19.2% in 12 months up to January, in production of capital goods for industrial use, significantly superior to the rate of expansion of industrial production as a whole, 6.9%, and to the rate of expansion of capital goods, 14.6%, indicating a growth path of the sector’s installed capacity, as well as of other productive segments, like transportation and agriculture.
The main impact of the demand warming is observed in the trade balance. The deficit registered in the year, up to the third week of March, reached US$ 689 million. Despite growth of 13.8% in the first two months in exports compared to the last year, imports have expanded at a higher speed (18.4%) in the period. The effect of the economic growth becomes transparent in the disaggregated data of imports: increase of 25.9% in the imported, and of 9% for capital goods in the last 12 months. Part of this increment, however, reflects not only growth in domestic demand, but also expansion of the exported quantity of manufactured goods, with a net positive effect, although lagged, over the trade balance. 
The increases of the trade deficit and of the current account deficit have contributed to affect the level of the exchange rate, which has increased from an average of R$1.81 in the third quarter of last year, to an average of R$2.02 in the year, up to March 20. Nonetheless, since February, the evolution of the exchange rate has started to reflect the deterioration of the external scenario. In particular, it can be cited, greater uncertainties as to the pace of deceleration of the US economy, reflected in part in the rapid decline in stock prices traded in its stock exchanges, and the confidence crisis in important emerging markets like Argentina and, in a minor degree, Turkey. 
The world economy has been marked by the deceleration in the United States and by stagnation of the Japanese economy, whereas European countries have sustained a moderate growth path. The international scene has also been influenced by volatility in oil prices. This volatility is not expected to be reduced in the short run, given uncertainties over the world  demand and the possibility of new cuts in OPEC’s production, in addition to the cuts already announced in January and March. 
Monetary policy in the US was marked by three consecutive cuts this year of 0.5 percentage point each in the fed funds rate. The US economy is going through a rapid deterioration in private confidence and an increase yet moderated in the unemployment rate, while the inflation rate remains stable. The monetary easing may affect positively the economy’s performance in the second half, although the magnitude and duration of the current deceleration are proving greater than expected by the majority of analysts few weeks ago. 
The emerging economies, although yet in a recovery cycle after the 1997 crisis and 1998, tend to suffer the impacts of a loss of dynamism in world trade and of the higher risk aversion of investors, associated with a larger degree of world uncertainty.
In relation to Argentina, the economy experienced a period of growing uncertainty about the growth capacity in the short run, and about the political support for the fiscal adjustment proposed by the government. The recent instability led to a dual change in command in the Ministry of Economy in March, and to an ample ministerial reform, facts which did not contributed to maintain the levels of external confidence and sovereign risk perception 
The behavior of prices in the first two months of the year was influenced by seasonal factors as readjustments of enrolment fees and tuitions, as well as by increases in raw food products. Also important were increases in urban bus fares and electricity, as well as water and sewage service fees in certain state capitals. The IPCA accumulated an increase of 1.03% in the first two months, compared to 0.75% in the same period of the year before. The sum of the accumulated inflation up to February plus the expected increase in administered prices over the year is to reach 2.4%, which represents 60% of the target for the year. 
In February, the groups transportation and education contributed with 0.31 percentage point for the variation of 0.46% in the IPCA.
The general price index – IGP-DI - grew 0.83% in the first two months of the year, being 0.49% in January and 0.34% in February. In equal period of 2000, they registered 1.22%. In the first month of the year, the increase in the index was favored by a decline in the price of agricultural products, which was reverted in February, having grown 0.3%. 
It is to be observed that the IPA, IPC and INCC registered lower variation rates, compared to January. In the case of IPA, rates reached 0.40% in January and 0.31% in February. This behavior was caused basically by smaller increases of industrial products prices (0.31% anti 0.78%). In the IPC, the deceleration was more pronounced, passing from 0.64%, in January to 0.4% in February. The INCC presented rates of 0.58% and of 0.34% respectively. This reduction was mainly caused by lower labor costs. It is to be observed that supply of certain products, as meet and milk, will contribute in a less intense degree to contention of prices, in relation to the pattern registered in 2000, given the occurrence of specially favorable meteorological conditions this year. Yet, it is to be considered the readjustments already predicted in contracts, in certain administered prices, to become effective from June, and the recent evolution of the exchange rate, reflecting the deterioration in the international scene. 
In the period between February 14 and March 20, the Central Bank maintained the strategy of rolling over entirely the updated principal of NBC-Es and NTN-Ds. However, to satisfy greater demand for foreign exchange hedge arising from aggravation of the external crisis, two extra auctions were carried out of NBC-Es of six months on March 19. Computing all definitive placements of NBC-Es and interest payments of such Notes in the market, the monetary result registered contraction of R$1.0 billion. 
Competitive operations with securities of responsibility of the National Treasury, by its turn, determined an expansion of R$2.9 billion in the monetary market, in particular, due to net redemption of R$1.0 billion of NTN-Ds. The National Treasury carried out eight auctions of LTNs, with the financial value of the sales reaching R$6.9 billion, in counter part to total redemptions of R$9.1 billion, in which it is included R$1.7 billion relative to three buy auctions of securities before maturity. In the period, it was carried out only one public offer of LFTs, of five-year tenure. This sale totaled R$1.1 billion, with an average discount of 0.03% per year. Redemptions of such securities summed R$1.3 billion. Ratifying the consolidation trend of the NTN-C market, it was carried out the first public offer of securities with tenure of ten years, as well as the re-offer of securities maturing in 2005. The sales reached R$0.5 billion, being 5% settled with the use of securitized credits of National Treasury’s responsibility. 
The identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed in accordance to the new information available. The scenario considered in the simulations contemplates the hypothesis listed as following:
a. observed inflation in February (0.46%) exceeded the expected value (0.20%),
b. international spot and futures oil prices receded around US$ 1.50 since February. Therefore, in spite of the depreciation of the took place over the first quarter, it is estimated a decline of 4.5% in the gasoline prices at gas stations in April (equivalent to an estimated decline of less than 6% at the refinery), and small additional reductions in July and September, 
c. the average readjustment estimated for administered prices in 2001 was revised downwards from 8.5% to 6.1%, with direct impact on the IPCA of 1.39 percentage point. That revision was motivated by three factors, beyond the already mentioned gasoline price. First, the adoption by IBGE of the usual methodology for the calculation of the item  “Domestic Employee” from April. That might reduce the variation of that item from 19.2% (readjustment of the minimum wage) to something around 11% in the year, with effects distributed along the year instead of fully concentrated in April. Second, the estimated increase in urban bus fares in 2001 was reviewed upwards, since in some cities there were no adjustments last year. And third, the average readjustment of electricity was re-estimated from 15.8% to 12.8%, 
d. following the future contracts’ projections, the hypothesis for the path of the fed funds rate includes an additional reduction of 25 basis points in the third quarter of 2001. Therefore, this rate would be reduced from the current 5.0%p.a. to 4.75%p.a., next stabilizing at this level, 
e. in the external scenario, the baseline assumes a deceleration of the US economy, with growth reduction concentrated in the first half, followed by a recovery starting in the second half. The baseline considers that the recent increase in Brazil’s risk premium shall be reverted over the year. In relation to the last meeting, however, it is projected a small upward shift in Brazil’s risk curve.
The other hypotheses considered in the previous meeting were maintained, in particular the realization of primary fiscal surpluses that meet the established fiscal policy targets. 
The IPCA core inflation calculated by the trimmed-mean method has increased from 0.42% in January to 0.54% in February. The same behavior was presented by the IPCA core calculated by exclusion. Excluding the influence of administered prices, the accumulated variation of the IPCA in the last 12 months increased from 3.2% in January to 3.8% in February, interrupting the declining trend initiated in September. Yet core inflation measured by the IPC-BR, released by Fundação Getúlio Vargas, fell from 0.44% to 0.36%.
The median of the expectation for IPCA variation collected through the daily survey of the Central Bank remained at 4.20% for 2001, but was reduced from 3.82% to 3.75% for 2002. 
The magnitude of the recent exchange rate variation, given the acceleration in the pace of economic activity, may increase the degree of passthrough to domestic prices. In this case, the inflationary pressure originated from the exchange rate channel could elevate the inflation rate this year. From the simulation exercises with the scenario considered in the basic (structural) model, the conclusion is that the maintenance of the interest rate at the current level of 15.25%p.a. represents non-negligible risks for meeting the 4% inflation target in 2001. 
The strong growth of the economy in the end of 2000 continued in the first months of 2001. This trend, nonetheless, has not yet resulted in imbalances between supply and demand, which would directly affect the inflation indices.
The main impact of aggregate demand expansion has been on the trade balance. Although imports partially respond to the increase in manufactured exports, it is undeniable that the demand pressure has affected the imported quantum. The net effect in the first two months of the year was a US$ 360 million increase in the trade deficit when compared to the same period of 2000. However, the prospects for the second and third quarters of this year are of improvement in foreign trade, due to the beginning of shipments of agricultural products. For the whole year, the trade balance will essentially depend on the growth differentials between Brazil and its main trade partners, and on the path of the real exchange rate.
The reduction in the trade balance and the corresponding increase in the current account deficit have contributed to weaken the exchange rate, despite the fact that external financing needs have increased only moderately. More recently, the exchange rate has been affected by the uncertainty in the external conjuncture, particularly in relation to the magnitude of the downturn in the United States’ economy and to the political crisis in Argentina. The recent behavior of the exchange rate, therefore, results from a combination of temporary as well as more persistent factors.  _ 
The recent currency depreciation raises the important issue of the passthrough from the exchange rate to domestic prices. Since the floating of the in 1999, the degree of passthrough has been declining steadily, given that only the part of the exchange rate variation perceived as permanent is transmitted to prices, without changing significantly inflation expectations. However, sharp exchange rate depreciations, albeit reflecting mainly the uncertainty in the markets, can increase the degree of passthrough, to the extent that part of the depreciation can be perceived as long-lasting.
The increase in core inflation in the last months, observed inflation above expectations, and the uncertainties related to the degree of passthrough from the recent exchange rate depreciation, given the accelerating pace of economic activity, when taken all together, indicate that there are risks for the achievement of the 4%- target for inflation in 2001.

27/04/2001;58;Arminio Fraga;"The indicators of the level of economic activity continued signaling robust expansion in the first months of 2001, mainly in the industrial segment. In March, however, statistics referring to the retail activity were less favorable than in the previous months. 
In the manufacturing sector, the industrial production surveyed by the IBGE, as well as the level of real sales, surveyed by the CNI, continued to grow in February, with increases of 1.53% and 6.32%, respectively, related to the same month of last year. The initial data released for March, referring to the vehicles segment, has indicated continuity of this expansion. In that month, 181,000 units had been sold, 33.5% above of the sales of March 2000. 
The seasonally adjusted total revenue, in real terms, of retail in the Metropolitan Area of São Paulo presented positive result of 1.9% in February, according to survey of the Trade Federation of the State of São Paulo (FCESP). In the year, real sales had accumulated increase of 7.1%, mainly as a result of total revenue of consumer durable segment, 11.8%, of non-durable, 13.9%, and of construction materials, 13.5%. It shall be observed that, despite the expressive growth of retail up to February, the rate is still below of the accumulated variation in 2000, 10.4%. The preliminary result (seasonally adjusted) for March, which fell by 0.75%, indicates a slowdown in the rhythm of expansion. 
Other indicators also show a downward trend in the rhythm of expansion of the retail activity. Data of the Trade Association of São Paulo (ACSP), referring to the number of consultations to the Credit Protection Service and Telecheque, show the reduction of 0.89% in March, considered the seasonally adjusted series. For the first fifteen days of April, it was registered expressive reduction in the number of consultations in relation to equal period of 2000. 
In part, the recent behavior of retail indicators can be attributed to the rise in default rates and to the deterioration of agents’ expectations. The Consumer Confidence Index, as tracked by FCESP, recorded 113.4 in April, 115.6 in March and 119.9 in February, in a scale that spans from zero (the most pessimistic) up to 200 (the most optimistic). The index decline in the last three months was, mainly, due to the perception of worse economic conditions. Regarding default rates, information of the ACSP had shown that the net rate (discounting the cancellations of new registers in the records of SPC) raised 32% in the first quarter of 2001 as opposed to equal period in 2000. In the same way, the relation between the number of checks returned for insufficiency of funds and the number of cleared checks reached an average of 4.47% in first quarter of 2001, compared to 3.55% in equal period in the previous year. 
Financial system credit indicators reveals that the stock of credit still records high growth. The balances of new credit operations within the free segment had registered monthly   growth of 5% in March, distributed in 5.4% for operations with individuals and 4.9% for funds borrowed by companies.
However, the new credit concessions, considering the daily average of the operations carried out in March, had recorded growth of 0.6% in the operations with individuals, and a reduction of 4.3% in the operations with companies, after growth of 9.2% and 7.1%, respectively, in the previous month. Growth in default rates, represented by credits in arrears for over 90 days, was moderate reaching 5.9% and 2% of the total of the credit operations of individuals and companies, respectively.
Despite growth in industrial activity, the utilization of installed capacity has presented relative stability, reaching 80.2% in February, keeping almost the same percentile of February of 2000, 80.3%, according to CNI. This behavior was due to, in part, the expansion of Gross Fixed Capital Formation in industry, trend that has being maintained in the last months, according to the numbers of investment indicators.
In this sense, it is pointed out the growth of 17.6% in the production and 39.1% in the TXDQWXP of imports of capital goods in the first two months of the year, performance that, along with the contraction of 3% in the of exports of this segment provides evidences of the expansion of apparent consumption of capital goods, suggesting the enlargement of installed capacity. 
In the agricultural sector, the Survey of Agricultural Production (LSPA) of February lead to a revision of the percentage growth of the grains’ harvest in agricultural year 2000/2001 to 12.4%, from 10.3% in the previous survey. The record harvest should reach 93.6 million tons, highlighting the increases of 26% and 8.6% foreseen in the production of corn and soy, respectively. The expected real growth of agricultural income shall contribute for the maintenance of the current level of domestic demand. 
The positive performance of economic activity has been reflected in labor markets. The open unemployment rate reached 5.72% in February, in comparison to 5.7% in January and 8.16% in February of 2000. Removing seasonal influences, the rate shows a downward trend since last October. The formal employment continued its recovery, growing, seasonally adjusted, 0.27% in the same month. Data of CNI and FIESP for industry confirmed the increasing trend of the employment level. In February, surveys performed by these entities indicated increase of 0.55% and 0.41%, respectively, in the number of job positions in Brazil and São Paulo, considering data seasonally adjusted. In February, the real wage bill in the industry grew 0.75%, according to CNI, and 1.13%, according to FIESP, reaching variations of 4.26% and 5.71% in twelve months, respectively. 
In relation to the flows of foreign trade, it is highlighted the impact of the expansion of domestic investments, which has pressured the imports of capital goods and intermediate goods, contributing to the deficit of USS 677 million in the trade balance in the first quarter. Exports grew 14.4% in comparison to equal period of the previous year, with prominence to basic products and manufactured products as well. 
The illnesses affecting European cattle enlarged exports of vegetal protein and Brazilian meats. The exports of soy bran and soy in grain grew significantly, benefited with price gains in the case of soy bran destined to feed animal. Exports of poultry meat, mainly to   Europe, commanded the increment of businesses with meats, followed by, in a smaller scale, the sales growth of beef and pork meat. 
The sales of manufactured products, such as airplanes, shoes, mobile phones and vehicles kept the good performance, outlining, in the case of vehicles, the maintenance of the importance of the US market. Oil derivatives sector (fuel oil and gasoline) had also shown strong growth in exports within the last months. 
In short, economic activity is strong and expanding in the first months of 2001. This behavior echoes, mainly, in the levels of industrial production, in more pressure on imports and in the favorable evolution of labor market indicators. Data recently disclosed, referring to March and April, signals a softening on this expansion, mainly in the activity of the retailing businesses, attributed to the expectations of a reduction in the supply of credit and to the less favorable economic conditions. 
The main determinant of the inflation in March was the growth in the prices of food. The IPCA increased by 0.38%, as against 0.46% in February, showing growth in expenditures with beans, raw food products, milk and poultry meat, which contributed with 0.18 percentage of inflation. The increase in the prices of medicines, mainly observed in mid- February, but with extensive impacts to March, contributed with 0.06 percentage point of the variation for the month. 
The General Price Index – Domestic Supply (IGP-DI) grew 0.80%, as against 0.34% in February, as a result of higher variation in IPC (0.56% anti 0.40%) and mainly in IPA (1.01% anti 0.31%). In the wholesale, emphasis shall be given to the price increases of animal and by-products - cattle, poultry, eggs and milk, as well as of beans and vegetables, that jointly, contributed with 0.82 percentage point of the variation of the IPA. In the IPC, the variation of these same items represented about half of the increase of the index. The IPC core grew 0.53% in March, reaching 4.43% over the past twelve months. 
The international scenario continued to present deceleration signs in the growth path. The stagnation of Japan and, mainly, the deceleration of the US economy reduced the perspective for world economic growth. In Latin American countries, the difficulties regarding this scenario are more pronounced due to the uncertainty about the development of the Argentine economy.
In the United States, demand indicators support a declining in the accumulated variation in 12 months, although still positive, with the exception of consumer credit that grows at rate higher than 10%. Industrial production recorded, in March, a growth of 0.4% in seasonally adjusted series, after drops for five consecutive months, but the accumulated variation in 12 months continued to decline, recording 4.5%, anti 5% up to February. The labor market reflects this context and suggests the companies’ adjustments. Hence, the unemployment rate recorded in March the highest level since July 1999, 4.3%. Confidence index in the manufacturing industry and consumers, that recorded a mild increase in March, does not suggest a deepening of deceleration of the U.S. economy. It shall be emphasized that price indices do not suggest inflationary pressures, despite the volatility in international petroleum   prices, so that the cuts in the interest rates by the Federal Reserve tends to contribute suitably to the performance of the economy, with a diminished inflationary risk. 
The uncertainties regarding the recovering of Argentina’s economic fundamentals and the resumption of growth contributed to increase the volatility in local financial markets, with higher interest rates on government bonds placements and also increasing spreads on external placements, notwithstanding the changes proposed by the new economic team. The unfavorable GDP results of the fourth quarter of 2000, which contributed to the contraction of the annual GDP and also to fiscal deficits larger than the previously expected. This environment influenced negatively the risk assessment of international agencies leading to rating revisions. 
In the weeks right after the last Copom meeting, the term structure of interest rates showed strong volatility, reflecting the uncertainty in the international market environment along with the Copom’s decision itself – considered a surprise to the market. As a result, losses were inflicted to fixed-income instruments. Between March 21 and April 17 there were two public selling auctions of dollar-indexed securities (NBCE), with tenures of 4.6 and of 2 years. These auctions were used to fully rollover principal and interest payments due in maturing instruments in April19. The choice of two placements intended to meet the demand for hedge at alternative maturities. The securities with longer tenure were fully placed at 11.20% p.a. and the securities with shorter tenures were placed at 10.95% p.a., both totaling R$ 2.9 billions. 
Regarding the monetary impact, considering settlements between March, 21 and April, 17, the operations with National Treasury bonds were responsible for an expansion of R$ 3.8 billion, particularly due to the net redemption of R$ 8.3 billion of LTNs. The operations with Central Bank notes generated a contraction of R$ 1.7 billion. 
The increase of the basic interest rate since last Copom meeting changed in the composition of domestic federal debt. The combination between net redemption of fixed-income securities and the price declined due to the interest rate increase reduced the stock of LTNs in the market (marked to market) to R$ 66.4 billion in April, 9, from R$ 74.5 billion in January. The net placements of LFTs in substitution of LTNs increased the stock of those securities to R$ 139.7 billion from R$ 126.0 billion in the same period. The share of dollarindexed securities increased to R$ 122 billion from R$ 108.8 billion in January. The average maturity of securitized debt decreased to 31.4 months in March from 32.2 months in February. The average maturity of the Federal Government issues reduced to 21.2 months in March from 45.5 months in February, due to the small offering of LFTs and to the shorter term of the auctioned NBCEs. 
The maturity schedule indicates redemption of about R$ 21 billion of LFTs, R$ 8.3 billion of LTNs and R$ 2.3 billion of NBCEs and NTN-Ds in March. In March, the average daily volume of final transactions, excepted repo operations totaled R$ 5.9 billion, compared to R$ 7.8 billion in the prior month. The downfall was observed in every group of securities and was due to the smaller volume of public offers and to the   deterioration in expectations. The daily rollover of fixed-income securities, particularly, shrank almost 41%, reducing to R$ 2.3 billion in March from R$ 3.9 billion in February. 
Identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed in light of newly available information. The scenario considered in the simulations is based on the following hypotheses:
a. the March inflation (0.38%) was above expectations (0.22%) due to the increase in food prices,
b. the international price of oil remains volatile. In the spot markets, prices rose since the last meeting, but futures markets still show a declining trend along the year. Considering the implicit price schedule from futures type- Brent petroleum contracts, the average for the year should be around US$ 25 per barrel,
c. the adjustments in electric energy prices for the remaining of the year was revised from 12.8% back to 15.8%, with the bulk of it occurring in the third quarter. The expected changes in telephone charges and public transportation fares were also reassessed. The timing and the size of projected changes in the item “domestic employees” was adjusted in light of the new methodology adopted, in April, by IBGE. Regarding the set of administered prices, including fuel, energy, public transportation, and telephone services, the expected average adjustments reaches 8.9%, with a direct contribution to this year’s inflation of 2 percentage points, 
d. it was also included the hypothesis that food price variation stays 0.5% below the overall inflation in the second quarter. This assumption is related to the harvest period, which tends to partially revert the unusual food price increases observed in the first quarter, 
e. according to projections implicit in futures markets, the hypothesis for fed funds encompasses a linear reduction from its current level of 4.5% p.a. to 4.0% p.a. at the end of the year, remaining stable thereafter, 
f. regarding the external scenario, it is assumed the deceleration of the US economy should be concentrated in the first half of the year, and followed by a recovery beginning at the end of the second half. The recent deterioration of Brazil’s risk premium is expected to revert during the year. Comparing to last meeting’s scenario, however, it is introduced a small upward shift in the Brazil risk curve. 
Other hypotheses considered in the previous meeting were maintained, particularly the one of attaining primary surplus targets. GDP growth was adjusted according to recent data released by IBGE.
From simulations using the basic structural model, it was concluded that keeping interest rate at the current level of 15.75% p.a., inflation projection for 2001 is above 4%, although comfortably within the tolerance interval. For 2002, inflation projection lies quite close to the 3.5% target.  
The IPCA inflation core, calculated by the trimmed-mean method, was raised from 0.54% in February to 0.59% in March. In twelve months, core inflation reaches 5.62%. The assessment of IPCA inflation cores, calculated by exclusion of items, leads to the conclusion that by leaving out administered prices and food, the twelve-month variation of IPCA remains around 4%. The inflation core of IPC-BR, released by Getulio Vargas Foundation, increased from 0.36% in February to 0.53% in March. 
The median of market expectations for IPCA inflation, surveyed by the Central Bank on a daily basis, presented the following evolution: for 2001, it was revised upwards from 4.20% to 4.50%, while for 2002, it was reduced from 3.75% to 3.68%. 
The strong demand in the last months has had an impact on the trade balance with imports growing at a faster pace than exports. In this context, the deepening of external uncertainties along with a more unstable domestic political scenario has contributed to maintain the exchange-rate under pressure. Due to a complex combination of factors, outlined above, the passthrough from exchange-rate variation to domestic prices is subject to considerable uncertainties. 
Since last Copom meeting, the economic environment has changed. First of all, the estimates for administered price changes were revised upwards. Public services charges will likely be raised by more than previously expected. Those tariffs pegged to the general price indices should be affected by the more pronounced influence of exchangerate variation on wholesale prices. As a whole, administered prices tend to account for 2 percentage points in this year’s inflation, which characterizes a major supply shock. Second of all, first quarter inflation stayed above both Central Bank and market expectations. This was mainly due to unfavorable performance of food prices. A closer look at inflation, however, suggests that there is room for a partial reversion of the adverse effect of some food prices. Improvement in weather conditions as well as the crops reach the marketplace shall contribute to this reversal. Likewise, there is not yet a clear evidence of an increase in the exchange-rate passthrough. For some products like poultry meet and beef, the observed passthrough has been slightly above expectations. For other products, however, such as electronic appliances, characterized by high import content, the observed passthrough has been below expectations. Nevertheless, the deterioration of agents expectations indicates the possibility of greater pressure for passthrough in the future. To the extent that the GDP growth stabilizes at a more moderate level, this pressure should be mitigated due to greater difficulties to transfer these costs to the price of final goods. With respect to positive changes in the scenario, it shall be underlined the broadening of the fiscal effort embodied in the budget guidelines proposal for the next two years, and the additional cut of half of a percentage point in the US basic interest rate. The latter shall mitigate the impact of the US growth deceleration on the world economy and will improve global liquidity conditions. The domestic interest rate term structure shows a steep positive slope. As a result, a reduction in the supply of credit by financial intermediaries is expected, which in turn   may lead to a moderation in the rate of economic growth. The most recent activity indicators of retail sales reinforce the prospects for stabilization of economic activity level. In case this trend is confirmed, which seems probable, there should not be additional inflationary pressures for this and next year.
Copom considered that the understanding of the basic concepts that guide its actions should be reinforced. 
The main objective of the Central Bank is to control inflation according with the targets established by Government, is the Central Bank’s main objective. Differently from the previous policy regime, the level of the exchange rate is not the target of the Central Bank, likewise no other specific price in the economy. Hence, exchange rate variations are only relevant to the extent that they may affect the IPCA inflation rate. Given that the relationship between inflation and exchange rate depends upon a variety of factors (whether the currency depreciation is temporary or permanent, whether or not there will be passthrough to prices) it is essential to stress that the target is the inflation rate and not the exchange rate itself. 
The main policy instrument of the Central Bank is the interest rate. Other monetary policy instruments are only complementary. For instance, in case of liquidity shortage and high volatility, the sporadic intervention in the foreign exchange market can be instrumental to allow a consistent price formation. The same applies in the case of dollar-indexed bonds. 
The impact of monetary policy on inflation is not instantaneous. The lag between Central Bank’s policy action and its effect on the economy requires Copom to take preemptive action by anticipating inflationary pressures, instead of reacting based on lagged information. The risk is of being late in the process of controlling inflation, which leads to higher uncertainty, with damage to economic activity and potential economic growth.
The Central Bank pursues the target trajectory for inflation of 4% in 2001, and 3.5% in 2002, with a tolerance interval of 2 percentage points. The tolerance margin is large since the target is defined for headline inflation (and not for its core or for a purged index) and does not contemplate any escape clause, as usual in other inflation targeting countries. Nevertheless, the Central Bank aims at the central point of its annual targets. The relevant distinction to be made is between the rigor of the planned objective and the performance assessment. This is analogous to a riffle shooter that would be content with hitting the target board, but always seeks to hit the bull’s eye, and not its surroundings. 
To assess when the Central Bank may use its tolerance interval requires the identification of the causes leading to the deviation. If the underlying cause is a demand shock, then the interest rate must be adjusted to bring aggregate demand back to its pre-shock trajectory. If the cause consists of a supply shock, the consensus among the majority of central banks is that second-round effects should be fought, but not the direct effect of the shock on the price level. Thus, in the case of a negative shock, action should be taken to let the deviation from target be only temporary. The reasoning is symmetric for positive shocks.
 It is necessary to be careful to avoid mixing-up changes in the price level with deviations of the inflation trajectory. For example, a supply shock with a one percentage point impact on the price level would imply an increase of one point in the twelve-month   inflation rate. By definition, this increase would remain embodied in the inflation rate for the next twelve months, fading out at the end of the period, provided that second-round effects were avoided. This requires that monthly inflation is brought back to levels consistent with the desired path in the months right after the shock. The tolerance interval serves the purpose of guiding Central Bank action under these circumstances, by helping to calibrate the speed of convergence to the desired trajectory for inflation. The important aspect is to have confidence in bringing inflation back to its target path.
In practice, classifying the shocks is not always an easy task. Current economic conditions encompass a combination of pressures. On one hand, one should take into account the effect of an expanding domestic demand in the last months, within a context of world economic growth contraction and increasing risk aversion. On the other hand, the overall adjustments in administered prices impact production costs and represent a supply shock to the economy, whose second-round effects need to be controlled. By its turn, the depreciation of the exchange rate has an impact on both, the production cost of goods, which use imported inputs, and also on the demand for tradable goods. The turbulent environment has reinforced the defensive nature of economic agents’ reactions to events in Argentina, and, to a lesser extent, to the domestic political environment. This suggests the temporary nature of part of the current pressure on the exchange rate. 
After assessing the macroeconomic scenario presented above and its indicators – the increase of the core inflation in the last months, the observed inflation above expectations, and the uncertainties regarding the degree of passthrough of the recent depreciation – it was concluded that the initial move made in the March meeting should be consolidated in order to realign the expected trajectory of inflation with the targets established for 2001 and 2002.  
"
01/06/2001;59;Arminio Fraga;"The indicators of the level of economic activity have shown signs of cooling, evidenced by, mainly, the evolution of consumption indicators for the last two months. This trend shall be accentuated in the next months as a result of the impacts of electrical energy rationing. Initial effects, as the deterioration of expectations and the new planning of future expenditures, as much on the part of consumers as of companies, should be reflected in the next results of economic indicators. In the productive sector, the restrictions of electrical energy shall be reflected, among others, in the reduction of the growth rhythm that has being observed, mainly in the industrial sector. 
Among the demand components, consumption is the one that has revealed the stronger loss of dynamism. Data related to total sales in commerce and consumer expectations indicate this behavior. In the retail segment, survey from IBGE, at national level, showed fall of 0.1% of the real invoicing of the commerce in the year up to March, after registering growth of 3% in January, comparatively to equal periods of the previous year. Data of the Trade Federation of the State of São Paulo (FCESP) showed growth of 6.2% up to April, against 8.1% in January. The consultations to the Credit Protection Service (SPC) and the Telecheque in the city of São Paulo also presented waning signs. The number of consultations to these services fell 2.1% in April, after seasonally adjustments, reducing accumulated growth in the year to 8.77% up to April from 10.42% up to March.
The performance of retail activity reflects consumer perceptions. Consumer Intentions Index in the Metropolitan Region of São Paulo, released by the FCESP, dropped to 101 in May from 106.3 in April. This drop is attributed to the internal political crisis and to the deterioration of the external scenario. Since the survey encompasses expectations from the beginning of May, the index had not yet reflected the negative impacts caused by the energy crisis.
Regarding default rates, information from the Trade Association of São Paulo (ACSP) showed that the net rate (discounting the cancellations of new registers in the records of SPC) reached 9.4% in April of 2001, against 9.3% registered in same month of the previous year. Up to April, there was growth of 22.6% in average net rate of defaults and of 27.9% in the relation between the number of checks returned for insufficiency of funds and the number of cleared checks.
Financial system credit indicators still do not clearly suggest cooling in activity level. Credit operations in the free segment registered growth of 3.5% in April (as opposed to 5.1% in March). This performance is associated, to a large extent, to the behavior of the credit destined to companies whose activities are related to the exchange rate, that showed growth of 3.8% in the balance of the operations with companies. When the referred modalities are excluded, these operations presented an evolution of 2.2% in the month, as opposed to 3.3% in March.
In the same way, the growth of 2.9% in April (as opposed to 5.5% in March) in the operations with individuals suggests a still high growth in the demand for personal credit and for acquisition of goods, despite the deceleration in response to the increase in lending rates. In April, daily averages of concessions of new credits in the categories of “personal credit” and “acquisition of goods” registered falls of 0.7% and 3.9%, respectively. 
On the supply side, the most encompassing data refers to March, reflecting, up to that period, the strong expansion of the economic activity. The GDP registered growth of 3.77% in the first quarter, encouraged, mainly, by the performance of the industrial sector, largely influenced by mining industry (+10.5%) and by the transformation industry (+6.4%). It shall be highlighted that in the manufacturing segment the use of installed capacity, according to survey of Fundação Getulio Vargas, reached 84% in April of this year, as opposed to 83% in April 2000. This result, compared to the growth of the sector observed in the last year, reveals, in part, the expansion of investments. 
This dynamism in the first months of the year reflects, in part, the good performance of exports and explains the high level of imports. Up to April, the trade balance presented significant growth of exports by increased shipments of beef and soy in grain and soy bran, due to plant health measures in European countries. The manufactured goods performance remained similar to that of the last months of 2000, mainly exporting products linked to the automobile industry. Deserve special mention fuel exports, item that gained importance since the end of 2000, as a result of the strategy that aims at swapping oil by products in surplus in the Country.
Imports also kept the performance of the last months, largely due to the maintenance of industrial growth, responsible for the rise of the expenses with acquisition of important items of capital goods, raw materials and intermediate goods. The increase of auto imports was equally significant, resulting from trade agreements and from the rise in imports originated from Asian countries.
The signs of gradual accommodation of economic indicators, mainly demand ones, would not jeopardize the desired expansion of economic activity this year. To the contrary, this slowdown would be beneficial to the economic environment by improving price performance – excessively impacted by agricultural prices - and the trade balance. However, one has to consider the future perspectives given now the energy crisis.
The implications, at this first moment, refer to the deterioration of the expectations and its unfolding on the flows of expenses and credit. The perspectives are of intensification of the process of consumption deceleration since May, mainly in relation to the goods whose sales involve future income commitments. Considering a longer horizon, the cooling of consumption will be conditional to the magnitude of the effect of the crisis on incomes and job levels.
Regarding credit, a slowdown in the volume of new concessions is expected in the short term and a fall in the medium term. This behavior will be conditional on the increase in lending rates and bank spreads, in the imminence of an augmented risk of default. Additionally, the demand for credit, as much for consumption as for investments, might be affected by the evolution of the income.
For the industrial segment, which has operated in a higher level when compared to the previous year, the energy crisis implies the reduction in the pace of expansion. However, the possibility of transferring energy consumption between sectors tends to reduce the impacts of the rationing on manufacturing. Moreover, processes of rationalization, substitution of energy sources and intensification of self-generation of electric energy shall contribute to the same objective. It must be observed that these processes, as well as the absence of accurate sectoral coefficients of energy-output relations in the various segments, make it difficult to precisely quantify the impacts of rationing on industrial production. 
In light of the above, even if the manufacturing is not strongly affected, the rationing of electric energy might cause contraction in exports as well as in imports. Exports of basic products shall not be significantly affected, as much for using relatively less electricity than industrialized ones, as for the fact that a substantial part of the exportable production occurs outside the rationing area. Among the main semi-manufactured products exported, there are the metallurgical products which intensively use electric energy. Nevertheless, some companies are self-sufficient in energy generation. It is likely, however, that exportable surplus be reduced. The manufacture production might suffer the direct impact of lower energy supply and also of reduced supply of raw materials and intermediate goods domestically produced, which might be replaced by imported inputs. 
Regarding imports, a fall in acquisitions of raw materials and intermediate goods is expected. This reduction, however, can be attenuated by the substitution of domestic supply by imported goods. In a similar way, the reduction in capital goods imports might be offset, in part, by the necessity to substitute energy generating equipment and to speed up the required investments to overcome the energy crisis. For fuels and lubricant, the import reduction, due to the contraction in economic growth, might be mitigated by the necessity to substitute electric energy for energy generated from oil by products. Therefore, both, exports and imports shall be impacted from cuts due to rationing and to the reduction in the activity level. 
Finally, regarding prices behavior, the immediate effect refers to the impact of surcharges on energy bills of “households”, already estimated to be around 0.15 percentage point in June’s IPCA. It shall be highlighted that this effect will be the opposite at the end of the process. As to the indirect impact of rationing, it shall be considered, on the one hand, the restrictive perspectives on supply and the consequent rise of costs. On the other hand, the further contraction of consumption flows and of investments tend to minimize prices pressures. 
In April, the price indices continued to be affected by the same factors observed in March. The main responsible for inflation in the period were food products, especially those of animal origin. The indices were also pressured by the exchange rate movement in the last months.
The inflation increase in April was due mainly to the food price behavior. The latter was a consequence of the draught and the losses of bean crops, as well as of the domestic effects of expanded meet exports, along with the impacts on the wheat byproducts from exchange rate depreciation. 
The IPCA accumulated 2% in the year and 6.61% in 12 months, with variation of 0.58% in April. The result was influenced by the contribution of 0.23 percentage point of the tradable goods, as milk, bean, poultry and bread. Among the non-tradable products, foods were responsible for 0.11 percentage point and the domestic employees contributed with 0.08 percentage point. In the case of administered prices, the increase in energy costs and in water and sewer charges were compensated by the reduction in alcohol and gasoline prices.
IGP-DI recorded variation of 1.13% in April, accumulating an increase of 2.79% in the year and 11.16% in 12 months. The breakdown of April’s IGP-DI was the following: 1.39% IPA increase, 0.86% IPC and 0.36% INCC. Regarding IPA, it shall be stressed that the acceleration of farm prices, contributed with 3.8% of the expansion in agricultural product prices and with 0.48% of the industrial products. These items also pressured the item food in the IPC, that registered an increase of 2.26% in April. The IPC core was raised to 0.64% in April, accumulating 6.07% in 12 months. 
For the near future, a drop in agricultural prices is expected. The behavior of administered prices will impact inflation results, given, among other factors, the surcharge on electric energy bills and the previously expected increase in electricity tariffs, the increase of bus fares in the city of São Paulo, and the increase in telephone tariffs, in June. 
The international economy remains in deceleration, due to the performance of the United States and the stagnation of Japan, while the rise in spot and future prices of oil remains as a key concern regarding the inflation path. In this context, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), on its May report, reduced the growth forecast for world output in 2001 from 4.2% to 3.2% in October of 2000. In Latin America and Brazil, uncertainties regarding economic and financial difficulties in Argentina should be added to this economic deceleration process. 
In the United States, the deceleration of economic activity growth lead the monetary authority to promote successive reductions of the basic interest rate in 2001, totaling 250 basis points until May 15, when rates reached 4% p.a.. Consumer credit whose twelve-month variation was above 10% until February, was lowered to 9.9% in March. The industrial production registered a contraction for the seventh consecutive month, recording - 0.3% variation in April. Hence, the accumulated variation in twelve months was reduced from 4.4% in March, to 3.7% in April. Deceleration signs are also remarkable in the labor market, with unemployment rate reaching 4,5% in April, and the amount of job openings dropping by 223.000 units in the same month. The first official estimate indicates GDP annualized growth of 2% in the first quarter of 2001, compared to an expansion of 1% in the last quarter of 2000 (in seasonally adjusted series). Output growth decelerated in relation to the same quarter of the previous year, reaching 2.7% in the 1º quarter of 2001, compared to 3.4% in the last quarter of 2000. The annual inflation rates for consumers and producers recorded a moderate increase in April, reaching 3.3% and 3.7%, respectively. 
The European Central Bank (BCE) reduced the minimum reference interest rate by 0.25 percentage point to 4.5% p.a., on May 11th, in response to lower activity growth in the Euro Area and to the downward trend of inflation towards 2%. Nevertheless, the harmonized price index (IPCH) has been registering monthly variations of 0.6%, 0.4% and 0.5%, respectively, between February and April, raising the annual rate from 2.6% to 2.9% in the last two months
In Argentina, the government has seek to revert negative expectations regarding the overall economy, while the country’s aggregate demand and industrial output has remained at low levels. Supermarket and shopping center sales in March grew 2.6% and 0.15%, respectively, compared to the same period of the previous year. The Monthly Industrial Estimator in March recorded a contraction of 1.1%, seasonally adjusted, implying an accumulated variation in twelve months of -1.5%. The fiscal results in the first quarter totaled a deficit of US$ 3 billion, 48% higher than in the same period of 2000. In spite of substantial increase in March and April, interest rates gradually decreased in May, as a result of news about the debt swap. The interest rate was at 15.10% p.a. on May 23rd for 30-day transactions in pesos and 11.80% p.a. for dollar transactions. On April 27th, in order to revert less than favorable financial markets expectations, the government implemented fiscal measures to reduce the deficit by US$ 4 billion. Among these measures were: the increase of the tax rate on financial transactions, from 0.25% to 0.4%, and a US$ 900 million cut in public expenditures. The third revision of the agreement with the IMF was concluded, with the increase by US$ 1 billion in the fiscal deficit target for the 1st half of 2001, in order to correct for the deviation from the original target for the 1st quarter of the year. The conclusion of the third revision allows the disbursement of US$ 1.2 billion of the financial package agreed in December. Additionally, the Argentine government is committed to complete debt swap process to lengthen the maturity of both internal and external debts
In the weeks following last Copom meeting the term structure of interest rates remained volatile. In the day before the May 23rd meeting, the slope of the curve increased for tenures above five months. This movement was mainly caused by the uncertainty regarding both economic and political impacts, in the medium term, of the energy crisis and the election process next year. Fixed-income instruments, therefore, continued to yield losses until the day before of the May 23rd meeting. 
Between April 19 and May 22, there were four public selling auctions of dollar-indexed securities (NBCE), with tenures of 5, 7 and 10 months. These auctions were used to fully rollover principal and interest payments. Securities with tenure of 7 months were partially placed (53%) and the average rate of placement stood at 13.60% p.a.. The other securities were fully placed. The shortest tenure reached 8.9% yield to maturity and the longest one reached 8.75% and 8.84% in two auctions, totaling R$ 5.1 billion. 
The National Treasury offered fixed income securities at only two instances given that both Selic rate and volatility remained high. The Treasury succeeded in placing R$ 0.9 billion in two tranches of five month securities at 20.39% p.a. average yield to maturity in the first auction and 21.65% in the second one. Five year tenure LFN’s were offered in four instances. The total nominal value was R$ 8.9 billion, with average discounts of 0.05%, 0.07%, 0.09% and 0.14% p.a., respectively. Twenty year tenure NTN-C totaling R$ 1.4 billion were offered in two tranches, yielding 10.78% p.a. with the simultaneous redemption of 52% of LFT-B and securitized credits of the National Treasury. 
Regarding the monetary impact, considering the financial redemption between April 19 and May 22, the National Treasury transactions caused an expansion of R$ 9.7 billion, due basically, to the net redemption of R$ 7.5 billion of LTN. The Central Bank operations generated a R$ 2.1 billion contraction. 
The increase in the Selic target rate decided in the last two COPOM meetings and the net redemption of LTN can explain the reduction in the fixed income instruments observed since March 2001. This drop totaled R$ 12.4 billion between February 28 and May 18 and the ratio to total domestic debt was reduced to 12% from 15% in the same period. On the other hand, the Selic indexed debt was raised by R$ 12.2 billion during the same period, which is strictly associated to the net placement of LFT and the net redemption of LTN. The dollar-indexed debt also showed an increase of R$ 19.4 billion, due to both the exchange rate devaluation and the net placements of NBC-E, in response to the demand for hedge.
In April, the average daily volume of final transaction was R$ 5.2 billion, against R$ 5.9 billion in the previous month. This difference can be explained by the low volume of public offerings and also the interest rate variation in the month. The reduction of 43.5% in the daily volume of LTN transactions was the main responsible for the reduction in the average daily volume of final transactions, since the remaining groups of securities showed increased trading volumes. The average daily volume of LTN’s in April was R$ 1.3 billion, after an impressive drop to an average of R$ 2.3 billion in March. As a result, the relative share of those securities was reduced to 25% in April from 39.6% in March.
Along with the public securities market, the future interest rate contracts showed less liquidity. The daily average of future DI decreased to 194 thousand contracts from 235 thousand in March. The October future DI remained the focus of the transactions. The turnover of term DI contracts was also reduced to 2 thousand contracts from 3.3 thousand, with no new transactions.
Identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed in light of newly available information. The scenario considered in the simulations is based on the following hypotheses: 
1. April’s inflation rate (0.58%) stayed on the upper limit of expectations due to the increase in the following items: Food and Beverage (1.8%), Domestic Employee (2.6%) and Electrical Energy (1.9%). The variation of these three components accounted for 0.55%, almost equivalent to the full change in the monthly headline index, 
2. The international price of oil increased since last meeting, maintaining high volatility of daily prices. Considering the implicit price schedule from futures type- Brent petroleum contracts, the average for the year should be around US$ 27.5 per barrel,
3. The projection for electric energy price adjustments for the remaining of the year was raised from 15.8% to 20%, including the surcharge to be levied on households’ energy bills, to be effective in June, adjustment in public transportation was also reassessed, taking into consideration the 21.7% increase in bus fares in the city of São Paulo, whose weight in the index is substantial. For the group of administered prices, including fuel, energy, public transportation and telecommunication, the total expected adjustment is 13.3%, which represents a direct contribution of 2.4 percentage points to this year’s inflation, 
4. The observed reductions in agricultural prices in the initial weeks of May justified the change in the underlying hypothesis for food price behavior: no variation in this group of prices is expected in the second quarter, reverting the strong increases observed until April, 
5. It is expected that fed funds rates remain at the current 4.0% p.a. level until the end of 2002, 
6. In the external scenario, it is assumed that after the recent elevation, Brazil’s risk premium tends to remain stable in the following quarters. This assumption is equivalent to an upward shift in the Brazil risk curve when compared to last meeting’s projected trajectory.
The electrical energy shock was initially modeled as a typical supply shock, reducing the growth rate and pressuring domestic prices. It was also considered as a temporary shock, i.e. its impacts are to be reverted in 2002. 
Other hypothesis considered in the previous meeting were maintained, particularly the one of attaining primary fiscal surplus targets. First quarter GDP growth was adjusted according to data released by the IBGE.
From simulations using the basic structural model, it was concluded that keeping interest rate at the current level of 16.25% p.a. yields inflation projections considerably above 4% in 2001. In 2002, however, inflation projections are very close to the 3.5% target.
The IPCA inflation core, calculated by the trimmed-mean method, was reduced from 0.59% in March to 0.46% in April. In twelve months, core inflation reached 5.63%. The assessment of IPCA inflation cores, calculated by exclusion of items, leads to the conclusion that by leaving out the influence of administered and food prices, the twelvemonth variation of IPCA remains around 3.5%. The inflation core of IPC-BR, released by Fundação Getulio Vargas, increased from 0.53% to 0.64% between March and April.
The median of market expectations for IPCA inflation, surveyed by the Central Bank on a daily basis, presented the following evolution: for 2001, it was revised upwards from 4.5% to 5.0%, and for 2002, from 3.68% to 3.8%. 
The strong economic activity at the beginning of 2001, in the context of growth deceleration observed in the economies of our trading partners, has influenced the level of imports, that grew at a faster pace than our exports. Hence, more pressure has been exerted on the current account balance and on financing requirements of the balance of payments, with a negative impact on the exchange rate. A series of particularly unfavorable events in both domestic and external scenarios are added to this environment. Among them, the Argentine crisis, domestic political instability and more recently the announcement of energy supply limitations in three out of the five of the country’s geographical regions. These events have contributed to maintain the exchange rate under pressure, since this variable immediately responds to risk perceptions of economic agents. The magnitude of recent exchange rate depreciation makes it more difficult, at least potentially, to keep consumer price inflation at low rates. 
The heating of aggregate demand observed in 2001 was accompanied by domestic credit expansion in the last months. Although some economic indicators suggests a contraction in aggregate demand at the margin, it is not yet the case with credit operations. In fact, credit volumes loaned out by the banking system increased 3.5% in April, suggesting that the more positively slopped term-structure of interest rates has not yet produced, in full, the expected reduction in loans. Despite the moderate increase in default levels and returned checks, the overall quality of financial institutions’ assets has not been affected. 
The increasing uncertainties since last meeting were, to a large extent, the result of announced restrictions in energy consumption, whose consequences can not yet be assessed with the desired accuracy. It is clear, however, that the impacts on aggregate supply will be severe, given the initially expected magnitude and duration of the reduction in energy consumption. This characterizes a supply shock.
In principle, this shock shall reduce more rapidly the quantity supplied of goods and services than the quantity demanded, which tends to lead to inflationary pressures and lower GDP growth rates. However, it is not a trivial task to adequately quantify these effects and their repercussions. For instance, the fall in supply will depend upon the capacity of the economy to adjust to the new environment by means of energy substitution, self-generation of electricity and rationalization of usage. Besides, should domestic demand not fall at the same pace of supply, which is probable, then the exceeding demand could be matched by imports or lead to price increases. The inevitable initial reduction in output growth tends to countervail the inflationary pressures over time by restoring supply and demand equilibrium. On the other hand, if aggregate demand is strongly affected by deteriorated expectations, then inflation and the trade balance would be less affected than output. 
Monetary policy shall seek to neutralize the secondary effects of energy rationing on inflation, particularly those whose impacts are to be felt in 2002. The primary consequences of this shock are not limited to the direct impact on price indices from higher energy costs. They also encompass the expected change in relative prices of goods and services due to the downward shift in supply, that tends to raise the indices. The secondary effects include eventual propagation movements generated by the initial price increases and have to be fought to avoid the offsetting of relative price changes, which would, by its turn, lead to additional price adjustments. 
Besides the energy shock, other relevant changes in the economic scenario since last Copom meeting shall be taken into account. In the external scenario, uncertainties remain, despite signs of improvement. In the case of Argentina, the attentions remain focused on the swap of short term debt for longer term instruments, and this situation should change only in June, after the settlement details are made public. In the United States, the new reduction of 50 basis points in the basic interest rate tends to improve global liquidity conditions and growth outlook for the world economy. This favors the continuity of adequate external financing of the current account balance, even in the context of lower direct investment flows.
In the internal scenario, April’s inflation was higher than expected, again as a consequence of food price increases. Some agricultural products had substantial price increases explained by the currency depreciation. This was the case of beef and poultry, whose exports were raised by strong external demand, and also the case of wheat and its by products. In the initial weeks of May, however, improvement on weather conditions and crops made available at market place have led to a substantial reduction in food prices. 
The trajectory of core inflation, calculated by the trimmed- mean method, showed a reduction in April, although its level is still high. Estimates for administered price changes were revised upwards, mainly due to the adverse evolution of international prices of oil. Moreover, other relevant factors underlying this revision are the temporary surcharge to be levied on household energy bills and the increase in public transportation (bus fares) in the city of São Paulo. Taking all together, administered prices shall have a 2.4 percentage point impact on 2001 inflation.
In sum, the Brazilian economy is facing several simultaneous adverse shocks, whose net effects on inflation need to be identified. Signs of demand slowdown are being observed since the increase in interest rates and the deterioration of expectations. In the opposite direction, there are the potential inflationary impacts of the continued exchange rate depreciation and of the energy shock, yet to occur. 
Copom concluded that the persistence of existing pressures on inflation and the probable secondary effects of the energy crisis recommend a reinforcement of monetary policy so as to realign the expected inflation trajectory with the established targets for 2001, and, mainly, for 2002.
"
03/07/2001;60;Arminio Fraga;"Recently disclosed economic activity indicators suggested that prior to evidences on the electrical energy crisis, the pace of economic growth was already exhibiting signs of deceleration. Such behavior shall be attributed to the already high production level__ to the increase in default and interest rates, as well as to the effects from unfavorable domestic political scenario and international economics conditions. Current expectations reinforce the perspective of cooling economic expansion in the coming months, influenced by the restrictions imposed by the energy rationing_program 
In the retail segment, monthly commerce real invoicing in the metropolitan region of São Paulo, disclosed by the Trade Federation of the State of São Paulo (FCESP), decreased by 3.9% in May, seasonally adjusted figures. Year-to-date variation reached 2.8% in May, relatively to 8% in March and 4.9% in April, mainly driven by the decline in sales of consumption goods and automobiles. The monthly trade survey carried out at a national stance by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), also points to a slowdown in the retail sector, which depressed by 0.7% in the first 4 months of the year. Adding to the indicators of retail activity, the number of cleared checks declined by 6.13% in May compared to the same month in the previous year. 
Consumer Intentions Index (IIC), released by FCESP, which captures consumers’ perceptions on current and future conjunctures, dropped by 19% in June, reaching 81.7, from 101.1 in May. This plummet, which confirms a downtrend commencing in March, reflects the negative impacts of the energy crisis. With such result, the IIC was displaced to the pessimistic area (below 100) from optimistic (from 100 to 200). 
Statistics from the Credit Protection Service (SPC) from the Trade Association of São Paulo (ACSP) showed that the net rate of defaults, which discounts cancellations of new registries, reached 8.1% in May 2001 compared to 6.2% in May 2000. Accumulated up to May, average net default rates rose by 24.1% along with a 30.9% surge in the ratio of the number of checks returned due to insufficient funds and the number of cleared checks. 
The total outstanding financial system's credit rose by 1.6% in May. Non-earmarked credit operations increased by 3%, responding to a 4.6% rise in the individuals' segment and a 1.9% augment in corporations'. Since February, new gross concessions have 3 remained at approximately R$ 2.1 billion to corporations and R$ 1 billion to individuals, on a daily basis. However, a waning of new credit operations is expected in the short-run due to less favorable conditions materialized into higher costs to the final borrower and to higher risk aversion upon concessions, which in turn mirror the recent hikes in basic interest rates and in uncertainty. 
On the labor market, the open unemployment rate, assessed by IBGE, increased to 6.51% in April, from 6.46% in March, although formal employment maintained its upward trend, which was positively impacted by the net hiring of 135 thousand workers in April. Yet, according to the monthly employment survey also carried out by IBGE, labor costs decreased in March. Average salaries, deflated by the INPC, had a negative variation of 0.28% compared to the same period of the previous year, accumulating a 0.49% loss year-to-date. As to the manufacturing sector, the unit labor cost, defined as the ratio of industry’s wage bill deflated by IPA-DI and industrial production, both released by IBGE, dropped by 5.96% in the 12-month period ending in February 2001. 
Regarding the manufacturing sector, April output decreased by 1.6% in the seasonally adjusted series compared to March, reflecting a decline in intermediate and consumption goods output and stability in the production of capital goods. Even though industrial output expanded by 7.1% in the first quarter, after including April outcome, expansion retreated to 6.8% in the year. The average utilization of installed capacity, as released by the National Confederation of Industry (CNI), also fell in April, reaching 81% from 81.9% in March. 
The positive performance of domestic capital goods production in April, in particular the production of electrical energy equipment, was replicated in other investment indicators. The production of civil construction’ inputs and the capital goods imports rose by 4.3% and 43.9%, respectively, in the first 4 months of 2001 compared to the same period of 2000. Up to April, BNDES disbursements had been elevated by 53%, special notice to credit concessions to the production of tradable goods.
Investment growth has been posing pressures to imports of capital goods, chiefly to electronic products, contributing to a US$ 546 million trade balance deficit accumulated in the year up to May. Imports grew by 17.4% in the same period, reflecting the accelerating pace of industrial production. Exports grew by 12.2% in the aforementioned period, basically reflecting an increase in shipments, for prices are practically unchanged when compared to the previous year. Noteworthy was the 32% soar in the sales to the North-American market, mainly composed of manufactured products such as airplanes, automobiles, fuel, footwear and transmission and reception devices.
In the first three weeks of June, the trade balance registered surplus of US$ 110 million, exports posing a reduction in daily average balances compared to May, albeit at a slower pace than imports. When compared to June 2000, both daily average exports and imports expanded by 2%. Exports of sectors with higher capacity utilization level, such as metallurgy and paper and pulp, fell compared to June 2000, offset by increased exports of meat and soybeans. As to imports, stronger reductions were recorded in the segment of raw materials to the textile industry (cotton, threads, synthetic and artificial fibers) responding to the increase in 2001’s domestic production of cotton, in addition to aircrafts and parts.
It is expected that the electrical energy rationing bring about deeper impacts in exports of semi-manufactured goods, inasmuch as some of the sector’s participants are electricity-intensive consumers. Exports of manufactured goods shall also be impacted, although to a smaller extent, due to the likelihood that domestically produced inputs be substituted by imported ones.
Weaker industrial activity levels are expected to reduce imports. Impacts shall be felt in all usage categories. Such trend should be lessened in the case of raw materials due to the depression in some of the domestic production and therefore its substitution by imported ones. As to capital goods, an increase in imports of alternative energy generation equipment may occur, with impacts on the imports of fuel. Nevertheless, non-related capital goods imports are expected to decline. 
Even though the electric energy rationing shall induce a reduction of exports and imports, the differentiated impact of the slowdown in the industrial activity in each of those categories should allow for a better-than-expected performance of the trade balance. 
The analysis of the recent evolution of the activity level reveals that the economy was already signaling a loss in dynamism in the months preceding the electrical energy crisis. Awareness of the crisis has intensified the cooling process of the economic activity, not only due to direct rationing effects but also to the deterioration of agents’ expectations, as captured by consumer and entrepreneurs’ surveys, which indicate cut downs in both consumption and investment. However, the intensity of the rationing impact on the activity level will depend, among others, on the rationalizing capacity of companies, on energy self-generation, energy sources substitution and inter-sectoral transfers of production. A slower pace of economic growth is expected, nevertheless. As a consequence, impacts in export and import flows may result in improvements on the trade balance in the following months.
In May, the main monthly inflation indices declined, driven by the performance of food prices, which reversed the significant ascent_observed in March and April. The several readjustments of administered prices, on the other hand, contributed to the maintenance of monthly variation above the levels verified in the same month of the previous year. The passthrough of recent exchange rate depreciation to prices has been_ in motion, although concentrated in the retail level and in few products, such as wheat by-products, beer, steel boards and copper wires. The passthrough has also reflected in the increase of administered prices, in particular, gasoline prices. 
The consumer price index IPCA rose by 0.41% in May, accumulating 2.42% in the year up to May and 7.04% in 12 months. Non-food prices directly contributed with a 0.28% variation in the month. The largest individual impact was of 0.07 percentage point from readjustments of electric energy tariffs. In the transportation segment, the most significant impact arose from the 21.7% readjustment in the urban bus tariffs in the city of São Paulo, in place after May 24th . Cooking gas prices, deregulated since May 4th, incremented by 3.68%, particularly influenced by the 29.95% hike observed in the city 5 of Goiânia. Food prices increased by 0.58%, significantly decelerating in regard to April (1.8%). The deceleration in price growth rates was generalized due to the larger supply of products such as beans, potatoes, tomatoes, onions, fruit, poultry and eggs. 
The wholesale price index IGP-DI increased by 0.44% in May, compared to 1.13% in April, accumulating 3.24% in the year and 10.9% in 12 months. The reversal observed in the monthly rate was led by the trend reversal in food prices, which drove agricultural index IPA to a decline of 0.64%, compared to a 3.8% inflation in April, and waned the expansion of the food item in the consumer price index IPC, which went up by 0.33% compared to 2.26% in April. While the full IPC index increased by 0.41%, the IPC core incremented by 0.52%, in response to the exclusion of a number of negative variations under the trimmed-mean criteria. The wholesale industrial prices elevated by 0.49% in May, a slight increment from previous month's outcome (0.48%), while the INCC accelerated, rising by 2.11%, mainly responding to wage readjustments, collective bargaining and cement prices. 
Administered price readjustments are expected to strongly influence IPCA variations in June and July, in particular the inclusion of urban bus tariff readjustments in São Paulo, as well as water and sewage services also in São Paulo, fixed telephone tariffs throughout the country and electrical energy in some capitals. On the other hand, food prices shall continue on a downward trend, attenuating the increase of the general index. Finally, the effects of energy rationing on the economy's price indices tend to be diminished, as already observed, and due to the perspectives of cut-downs on consumption in the following months which will likely curb the passthrough of cost hikes to prices and price increases due to supply shortage.
More recent information have ratified the cooling trend of the international economy, especially the United States, with Japan still facing difficulties to surpass its economic recessive trajectory as external demand weakens. In the Euro Area, the recent Monetary Policy expansion aimed at stimulating inland demand as a means to offset the loss in exports dynamism, although the inflationary scenario tends to bind expansion of future credit supply. In Argentina, the deepening of the recessive scenario has been postponed by positive exports performance, while the instability in the financial markets has waned after the revision of the IMF agreement and the sovereign debt swap. New economic measures were released in mid-June, aiming at reactivating of the economy. 
In the United States, the economic indicators still do not suggest a response of the expansionary monetary policy implemented since January 2001, showing deceleration of the activity level. GDP growth in the first quarter of 2001, initially estimated at 2%, was revised to 1.3% in the seasonally adjusted series, compared to a 1% expansion in the last quarter of 2000. In May, the industrial output contracted for the eighth consecutive month, declining by 0.8%, countersigning the economic slowdown. Annual inflation rates recorded growth, not detected in the core inflation. In May, the Consumer Price Index rose by 3.6% in 12 months, after a 3.3% increase up to April, while the CPI core registered annual variation of 1.6% in April and May. 
The Euro Area performance indicates a loss of dynamism due to the contraction of domestic and external demands. GDP grew by 2.5% in the first quarter as to the same period in 2000, compared to 2.9% in the last quarter of the previous year. Industrial output waned, with annual expansion reducing to 3% in March, from 5.5% in January. Price trajectory evidences inflationary acceleration. The harmonized price index registered annual variation of 3.4% in May, compared to 2.6% in March, with rising monthly variations. Corporations’ confidence index in Germany and France pointed to expectations of economic activity deceleration, while in Italy the indicators foresee recovery. Hence, the European Central Bank (BCE) decided to maintain the minimum basic interest rate at 4.5% pa. 
In Argentina, the revised agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), together with the recent debt swap and the last measures designed to stimulate the economy were recognized as attempts to reverse expectations regarding the fundamentals of the economy. 
Macroeconomic indicators in Argentina persist on a less than favorable evolution, except for the commercial performance. Industrial output grew by 1.2% in April, but remains on its downward trend initiated in January 2001 as to 12-month figures. After a feeble recovery in March, demand indicators retracted in April. The most positive performance of the economy relies on the external sector, reaching a surplus of US$694 million in the accumulated series up to April, compared to US$269 million in the same period of 2000. On the other hand, National Treasury’s deficit reached USS 1.1 billion in May, accumulating USS 5.1 billion year to date, which will require a surplus of US$ 200 million in June to meet the target for the first half. 
The Argentine government carried out a debt swap operation at the beginning of June, which amounted to US$29.5 billion in redeemed bonds, lengthening the maturity of the sovereign bonds and reducing the public sector borrowing requirements by US$16 billion up to 2005. In June 15th, the government released a new set of measures in order to foster economic recovery. Among these measures were changes in the collection of the Value Added Tax (VAT), deductions in the income tax incident on wages ranging from US$ 1.500 to US$ 4.000, tax exemption on salary increases up to US$ 150 by the distribution of food and transportation benefits for salaries lower than US$ 1,500, increase in the social security contribution ratios, subjected to tax compensation and reduction in the Common External Tariff (TEC) on consumption goods. 
In addition, the Argentine government designed a foreign trade transitory regime to be operated by means of a convergence factor. Such factor is to be calculated by the Central Bank of the Argentina Republic on a daily basis, considering the simple average of the difference between the parity of dollar and euro in London’s interbank_market, and it will be used to increase the import costs and create a bonus for exports.
The interest rate curve continued to present variations after the last COPOM meeting in May. The market experienced a relief as a consequence of the announcement of the debt swap in Argentina, immediately contributing to the drop in the premium embedded in the future interest rate in Brazil. The annual interest rate of one year DI term contracts 7 decreased to 20.30% on June 8th, from 23.05% on May 23rd. In this period, a lower impact in the movements of the exchange rate in the interest market was observed. In the week between June 11 and 15, the curve’s slope presented gradual increases. The spread between the one-year term DI rate and the Selic target increased to 505 bp in June 15, from 392 bp in June 11. In June 18, the curve showed an impressive increase in the slope to tenures lower than four months and also a significant upward parallel movement for higher tenures, with the VSUHDG reaching 635 bp. This movement was essentially due to uncertainties that generated an adverse impact on the secondary market of sovereign debt for emerging countries. Market’s fixed-income portfolio presented an increasing loss compared to the eve of last COPOM meeting. 
Of the six public auctions of NBCE settled between May 23rd and June 19th, five auctions were placed with 10-month maturity and one with 16-month maturity. The strategy adopted was the full rollover of the updated principal, plus interest (three auctions totaling R$ 3.9 billion), in order to meet the additional demand for KHGJH (three auctions, totaling R$ 6.9 billion). The average rate ranged from 7.36% pa and 8.19% pa for the auctions conceived to roll de exchange rate linked debt and from 8.35% pa and 9.72% pa for the auctions designed to meet the demand for hedge. The average ratio demand/supply was of 3.9 for the auctions designed to roll the debt and 2.2 for hedge demand.
Four selling offers of fixed income securities were placed between May 23rd and June 19th. They referred to five-month tenure securities at average rates of 20.13% pa in the first auction, 20.57% pa in the second, 19.97% pa in the third and 19.34% pa in the last one. The total amount settled reached R$ 4.6 billion. The average demand/supply ratio was of 2.5. The National Treasury’s decision to increase the volume of fixed securities was due to the lower volatility observed in market’s interest rates. 
The four auctions of LFT settled in the period totaled R$ 13.7 billion. The securities were offered with five-year tenure and average discounts of 0.16% p.a., in the two first ones and 0.15% p.a. for the outstanding. Selling offers of four-year and ten-year NTN-C were place with yield to maturity of 10.50% and 10.60% p.a., respectively, reaching R$ 565 million, with R$ 33 million being settled through exchanges with securitized credits of the National Treasury. Considering the settlements between May 23rd and June 19th, there was an expansionist monetary impact of R$ 2.2 billion. Operations with National Treasury’s securities imposed an expansion of R$ 9.2 billion, mainly due to net redemptions of R$ 5.1 billion of LFT and R$ 3.4 billion of LTN. Operations with Central Bank’s securities, on the other hand, generated a contracting monetary impact of R$ 7.0 billion. 
The average tenure of the issues wase reduced to 43.8 months in May from 47.3 months in April. This reduction is associated with National Treasury’s decision to offer fixedrate securities LTN. The average tenure of the stock of debt increased to 33.6 months in May from 32.0 months in April, essentially due to the approximately 3-month increase in the average tenure of the Selic-indexed debt. 
Among the owners of federal securities, Financial Investment Funds held approximately 46% of the fixed debt and 52% of Selic-indexed debt. The remaining of the debt, mostly 8 composed of dollar-indexed and price-indexed securities, was in financial institutions portfolios. Financial Investment Funds have changed their portfolios in the past months more significantly compared to financial institutions. Since the beginning of April, the participation of LTN in those funds securities portfolios reduced to 12.6% from 18.6%, against a surge in dollar-indexed securities to 17.7% from 14.6% and Selic-indexed securities to 67.4% from 64.9%. The net redemption of LTN in April and May and the significant exchange rate devaluation observed in the last month explain such movement.
In May, the average daily volume of definitive transactions reached R$ 5.7 billion, compared to R$ 5.2 billion last month. The low volume registered in the last three months may be explained by the absence of fixed securities auctions in March added to the low offered volume of these securities in the other two months, besides the high volatility of the interest rates. 
Along with the fixed-rate securities market, the future interest rate contracts presented a liquidity reduction in May. The daily average of negotiated contracts of future DI reduced to 163 thousand from 194 thousand. The DI future contract for October continued to concentrate negotiations. The daily turnover of term DI remained stable in 2.0 thousand contracts, again without new contracts’ redemptions. 
Identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed in light of newly available information. The scenario considered in the simulations is based on the following hypotheses: 
1. May’s inflation rate (0.41%) was in line with expectations,
2. The international price of oil declined in the last few days, albeit daily prices have exhibited high volatility. Considering the price schedule implied by Brent crude oil futures contracts, the average for the year is assumed to be around US$ 26.5 per barrel, 
3. The projection for electricity price increases for 2001 was changed to 20%, considering some adjustments already authorized for areas covered by the IPCA. Adjustments for public transportation were also reassessed, taking into account increases in bus fares above expectations. For the set of government managed prices, including fuel, energy, public transportation and telecommunications, the total expected adjustment is 13.1%, which represents a direct contribution of 2.9 percentage points to this year’s inflation, 
4. Reductions in agricultural prices in May, indicated by some price indices, were not confirmed by the IPCA. The increase in food and beverages prices reached 4.71% this year, while the IPCA as a whole rose 2.42%. Therefore, the hypothesis for the evolution of food prices was changed to incorporate some deflationary pressure in June and to follow the average of the other prices for the remaining of the year,
5. The inclusion of the term structure of domestic interest rates in the inflation forecast models, as specified in the June 2001, demands the specification of 9 hypotheses as to its slope. The assumption is that the slope of the interest rate curve would remain positive, smoothly declining through time up to the end of 2002, 
6. The hypothesis for the path of the Fed Funds rate, in line with the path for the rate indicated in the futures contracts, is of a reduction from the current level of 4% to 3.5% per year in the third quarter of this year, and stability thereafter, 
7. In the external scenario, the persistence of uncertainties is assumed to maintain the Brazil risk premium stable over the next quarters. Regarding the electricity shock, results yet preliminary of the modeling efforts point out to a reduction in the economic growth rate this year. Net effects on inflation, on the contrary, tend to be minor, especially when compared to the effect of other shocks such as that of government managed prices. The IPCA inflation core, calculated by the symmetric trimmed-mean method, rose in May to 0.60%, mainly due to food prices. In April, most of the items excluded for being in the upper tail of the distribution belonged to the food group and presented very high rates, contributing to the core’s value of 0.46%. In May, the IPCA captured price deceleration for these items, whose fall should be completed by June. Thus, some of those items were included in the core, raising it. Over the last twelve months, core inflation reached 5.9%. The evaluation of the IPCA exclusion core rates leads to the conclusion that, by excluding the influence of managed and food prices, the twelvemonth variation of the IPCA remains around 3.7%. The IPC-BR inflation core, released by Fundação Getúlio Vargas, fell from 0.64% to 0.52% between April and May, accumulation 4.95% in twelve months. 
The median of market expectations for IPCA inflation, surveyed by the Central Bank on a daily basis, presented the following evolution: for 2001, it was revised upwards from 5.00% to 5.50%, and for 2002, from 3.80% to 3.82%. 
The remaining assumptions established in the previous meeting were kept unchanged, in particular the achievement of the primary fiscal surplus according to the fiscal policy targets.
Simulation exercises with the scenario considered in the basic (structural) model leads to the conclusion that the preservation of the interest rate at the current level of 16.75% per year would result in inflation near the upper limit of the target for 2001. However, for 2002 the projected inflation is below the 3.5% target 
Economic activity continued to grow robustly in the first quarter, followed by an apparent moderation at the beginning, and a substantial drop at the end of the second quarter. Industry led the expansion, and the growth of capital goods production suggests an increase in the investment rate. The marginal deceleration is confirmed by the consumption indicators of April and May and by the reduced demand for credit. 
The reduction in energy consumption has been well assimilated by society, although its implications may differ between individual consumers and activity sectors. The energy crisis also has different effects on each macroeconomic variable. There is no doubt that it will have negative effects on output growth this year, but the magnitude of this impact is difficult to quantify. On the other hand, there is a growing consensus that the net impact on inflation tends to be lower. Another important consequence of the energy crisis is to alter expectations, due to its contribution to domestic political instability. 
Besides these domestic uncertainties, the external scenario remains troublesome. The global economy still does not shown signs of recovery in growth. The United States’ and the Euro Zone’s economies still lack strength, while Japan’s remains stagnant. Oil prices remain high, despite the recent fall. Therefore, despite the resultant slackening of monetary policy in these economies, the environment of risk aversion remains. 
Argentina’s situation has improved since the last meeting. The country completed an important lengthening of part of its short-term public debt, making room for advances in the economic stimulus and fiscal reform program. A return to economic normalcy, however, depends on the confirmation of an improving fiscal outlook and consistent signs of economic recovery, which will take some time. 
The exchange rate deserves a detailed discussion. In the first months of the year, part of the gradual depreciation of the exchange rate could be explained by the perception of deterioration in the balance of payments and other domestic and external uncertainties. The worsening uncertainties in this period had strong repercussions on Brazil’s risk perception, lifting the costs of raising capital abroad. Moreover, the balance of payments' performance was not particularly favorable. The negative outcomes for the trade balance reflected the strength of domestic demand in opposition to the global economic deceleration, suggesting that imports would remain strong, while exports would face foreign demand constraints. As a result, the expected magnitude of the current account deficit was rising, while the expected flows of foreign direct investment were declining. Therefore, it was natural to expect that the foreign exchange market would seek a new equilibrium.
The potential pass through from exchange rate depreciation to prices was one of the reasons for the reaction of monetary policy in the period, with an increase in the interest rate to attempt to neutralize these effects. Inflation expectations, although they were revised upward, did not accompany the pace of depreciation, indicating that part of the latter was not perceived as permanent and, therefore, should not be transmitted to final prices. However, the total impact of the pass through from depreciation to prices should also include the effect on the adjustment of tariffs and other managed prices, especially of gasoline. In this more general context, the exchange rate depreciation is estimated to contribute with at least 1.5 percentage points to the expected inflation for this year. 
More recently, however, the dynamics observed in the foreign exchange market changed. Over the last few weeks, the domestic price of the dollar rose considerably. This despite the fact that, in this period, the forecasts of the economic impact of the energy crisis became less pessimistic and there was some improvement in the external scenario. Basic interest rates fell in the United States and in Europe, and Argentina successfully completed a debt swap operation. The pricing process in the foreign exchange market seemed to present new dynamics, decoupled from the usual 11 fundamental determinants: the dollar’s price rises simply because a growing number of market participants believe that, since it rose in the past, it will also rise in the future. Therefore, those who otherwise would purchase foreign currency only in the future prefer to do so right away, whatever the current price might be, since they believe that procrastination may be too costly. Although this self-feeding process of exchange rate depreciation is not sustainable in the medium run, it may have nefarious consequences for the economy while it lasts, by distorting consumption and investment decisions, affecting corporate balance sheets, and, most of all, changing relative prices and threatening the inflation targets.
 Copom determined that measures should be implemented so that price formation in the exchange market ceases to present the characteristics of a speculative bubble. These measures include an elevation in the cost of maintaining speculative positions and the adoption of the disposition to irrigate the market with additional resources, stemming from reinforcements to the financing of the balance of payments, in order to provide the adequate liquidity for price formation and to avoid the anticipation of future demand for defensive or precautionary reasons. These actions will be backed by the implementation of important structural measures in banking and taxation.
Inflation measured by the Broad Consumer Price Index – IPCA accumulated 2.42 percentage points up to May. This figure is above expectations as a result of (i) the increase in food prices in the first five months of the year, surprising considering the arrival of the agricultural crop, (ii) the increase in government-managed prices 4.2 percentage points above the model's projections, and (iii) the partial pass through of the exchange rate depreciation. Moreover, core inflation measures remain high and managed prices are expected to increase 13.1% in average. Copom considered that the prospect of inflation considerably above 4% in 2001 represents substantial risk for the accomplishment of the target. On the other hand, the path of inflation, in the absence of spiraling exchange rate depreciation, is at present consistent with the 3.5% target for 2002.
In sum, Copom concluded that the persistence of existing pressures on inflation and the potential effect of an unstable process of exchange rate depreciation recommend a reinforcement of monetary policy through a significant elevation in the interest rate, so as to realign the path of expected inflation with the established targets. Two proposals were considered: an increase in interest rates at the upper bound of market expectations or a larger increase, with the simultaneous indication of a downward bias. The second alternative was chosen because, although more complex, it indicates more clearly a proactive approach in seeking a reversion of the present situation. The downward bias was introduced in the understanding that the measures to be announced might contribute to a rapid reversion in inflation expectations.
"
30/07/2001;61;Arminio Fraga;"The domestic economic activity continued to show cooling signs at the end of the semester, confirming the prevailing scenario at the last COPOM meeting. This performance may be related to the impacts of the energy crisis and of the instability in international markets, which fostered the deterioration of economic agents’ expectations. However, more recent information related to the consumer behavior indicates that the harsh initial reaction, expressed in face of the expectations of economic activity rationing, has already been minimized, contributing to some recovery of general indicators of commerce. Nevertheless, the retraction on the sales of durable goods, specially electronics, remained, given the unfavorable evolution on the credit conditions and also energy rationing effects. 
The retail activity in São Paulo, as surveyed by the Trade Federation of the State of São Paulo (FCESP), showed an increase of 0.2% in June, after a decrease of 5.2% in May, in the seasonally adjusted series, standing at a level 6.6% lower than in June 2000. With his result, the accumulated growth in the year reduced to 0.9% in the semester from 2.8% up to May. The retail sales index  calculated by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), with national coverage, dropped by 0.96% in the first five months of the year, compared to the same period of last year.
Default indicators remained higher than in 2000, although monthly evolution indicates stability or decline. According to the Credit Protection Service (SPC) from the São Paulo Trade Association (ACSP), the net rate of default, which discounts the cancellations of new registries, reached 7.6% in June, contributing to a 8.9% average in the first half of 2001, compared to 6.8% in the same period of the previous year. The ratio of number of checks returned due to insufficient funds and cleared checks reached 5% in June, with a 4.7% average in the first six months of the year, whereas the average of the first half of the previous year stood at 3.6%.
The Consumer Intentions Index (IIC), measured by the FCESP, indicated that, in July, consumers' behavior still reflected the deterioration of economic indicators, mostly external and energy crisis related. These factors had already significantly and negatively impacted the index in June. As a result, the IIC reached 90.87 in July, compared to 81.70 in the previous month, still in the pessimistic region, although posing recovery both in present and future intentions. 
For the past three consecutive months, the industrial production, as tracked by IBGE's Monthly Industrial Survey, has showed a decline, reducing by 1.5% in May, seasonally adjusted figures. This decline reduced the growth accumulated in the year to 6.2% from 7.1% registered in the first quarter. Despite the result, the level the installed capacity usage, as calculated by the National Confederation of Industries?CNI, based on information from twelve States, remained stable between April and May. The expectation is that, in June, industrial production fell, grounded on the retreat on the production of auto-vehicles and agricultural machinery, as well as on waved cardboard dispatching. 
Nonetheless, credit, investment and employment indicators still do not significantly reflect signs of deceleration. The total outstanding credit stock reached R$347.3 billion in May, posing a 1.8% growth. This volume is expected to reduce significantly in June, as a result of the Strengthening Program for Federal Financial Institutions, which aims at adjusting net-worth imbalances of these institutions, impacting ear-marked outstanding credit. Consequently, the share of non-earmarked credit outstanding on the total will rise to a large extent. 
The stock of non-earmarked credit outstanding rose by 2.8% in June, due to a 2.5% increase in the operations with corporations and 3.3% in the operations contracted with the individuals segment. Regarding new loans, in the same period, the daily average concession to corporations grew by 5.8% and those contracted by households increased by 3.2%. This performance, after the observed drop in concessions in the previous month, may be partially explained by the substitution of external loans for domestic ones, by the liquidity reduction in the non-banking credit market, which stimulates the demand for banking loans, and by the increased demand for overdraft account loans in both segments. Regarding corporations, credit has contributed to the adequacy of production to conditions determined by the energy crisis, and is responding to cash-flow recovery needs, given reduced demand and consequent inventory formation
The evolution of investment remains favorable, as assessed by the domestic absorption of capital goods and production of inputs to supply civil construction. Even though capital goods and input production for civil construction in May contracted by 2.3% and 2.7% respectively, in the seasonally adjusted series, the absorption of capital goods rose by 19.1% and the civil construction by 3.6% in the first five months of the year, comparatively to the same period of the previous year. The absorption of capital goods elevated by 31.6% in the first five months of the year, in spite of a 6.7% contraction in may. This performance was responsible for a 19.4% expansion in gross fixed capital formation as a share of GDP in the twelve months ending in May 2001, from 18.6% in the same period of 2001. Noteworthy was the 8.2% growth in May in the production of capital goods for electric energy generation, seasonally adjusted series, accumulating a 37.1% expansion in the first five months of the year. 
Until May, a favorable trend was in place in the labor market. Records from the Ministry of Labor and Employment pointed to a 3.1% growth in formal employment accumulated in the year, with the hiring of 465.5 thousand workers. The unemployment rate, as measured by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics?IBGE, based on a domicile survey conducted in six metropolitan regions, increased to 6.9% in May from 6.5% in April, which resulted from a 0.4% growth in the number of employed, insufficient to offset the 0.8% rise in PEA (employable population). On the other hand, unemployment rate in all months of 2001 has been below the rates observed in the same months of 2000. 
The trade balance recorded a US$277 million surplus in June mainly driven by export growth, which registered daily average record levels (US$252). As a result, the trade balance deficit in the first half of 2001 reduced to US$70 million. In the same period, imports, on the other hand, increased at a faster pace than exports, which hampered the replication of the surplus observed in the same period of 2000. A medium term improvement in the trade balance is expected due to the actual decreasing growth rate observed in both export and imports, more accentuated, however, in imports. 
The current conditions of world growth have negatively impacted Brazilian exports as to what demand and prices are concerned. Depressed international prices of food and raw materials commercialized by Brazil unfavorably reflected on the terms of trade in April and May, seasonally adjusted series, with direct impacts on country’s receipts. In spite of that, exports have registered increased shipment volumes of some export items, such as soy, chicken, meat, and sugar. 
Capital and durable consumer goods, in particular auto-vehicles, were the items leading import growth in the first half of 2001. Imports of those categories fell in June, compared to the previous month, and maintained a decreasing growth trend compared to the same months of 2000. Capital good imports increased by 25.6% in the first half and 3.9% in June. Imports of raw material and intermediate goods behaved accordingly, growing by 9.1% in the first half and contracting by 1% in June. The reduction in the domestic activity level expected to occur until the end of the year should accentuate this cooling trend in imports, contributing to a balanced result in the trade account. 
The impacts of the reduction in the electricity supply on the future evolution of production are directly related to the capacity consumers have to rationalize and self-generate energy, in addition to the intersectoral transfers of excess supply and the use of alternative electricity sources. The expressive adhesion of the Brazilian population to the rationing program, with targets to residential and commercial sectors being outperformed suggest that the effects of the energy crisis may be smaller than initially expected. Yet, projections on GDP growth for 2001 have already incorporated the slowing pace of economic activity.
To conclude, the deceleration of the industrial sector, particularly the transformation segment, may be specially due to the reduction in demand as a response to lower consumer confidence, associated not only with the rise in interest rates and to the reduction of financing tenures, but also with restrictions deriving from reduced energy supply. Investment, credit demand and employment levels, however, have not been fully affected by this cooling evolution. 
In June, consumer price indices were mainly influenced by the increase in administered prices. Those pressures, however, were partially attenuated by the deceleration in food prices. The evolution of wholesale price indices, on the other hand, basically reflected the passthrough of the exchange rate. 
The IGP-DI increased by 1.46% in June, as a result of the 1.96% rise in IPA, compared to 0.18% in May. Wholesale prices, both agricultural and industrial, mirrored the exchange rate depreciation. It shall be stressed the pronounced increases in iron, steel and its by-products, mechanicals, electric material, plastic substances, cereals and grains, and crops for exports.
The IPCA raised by 0.52% in June, mostly responding to the increase of 1.53% in administered prices, which represented 0.39 percentage point of the index. The main pressures in administered prices originated from the increase of urban bus tariffs in the city of São Paulo, responsible for 0.23 percentage point of the variation, water and sewage tax readjustment (0.07 p.p.), cooking gas (0.03 p.p.) and fixed telephone tariffs (0.04 p.p.). The rise of the IPCA in the month was attenuated by the reduction in prices of pharmaceuticals (-0.10 p.p.) and LQ_QDWXUD food (-0.13 p.p.).
Increases in administered prices are expected to continue to impact price indices in July, mainly from telephone, fuel, electric energy and, to a smaller extent, urban and interstate bus tariffs. The influence of the minimum wage increase, effective after April, shall be added to these factors and is likely to especially impact the IPCA, due to the two-month lag to incorporate data from the monthly employment survey released in May. Regarding IPA, the effects of the exchange rate depreciation tend to be important, in addition to the pressure resulting from fuel price increase.
The international economy is still on the cooling trend. The United States’ economy does not exhibit recovery signs yet, although executives’ expectations improved in June. Early expectations of recovery beginning in the second half of 2001 were postponed to the last quarter of 2001 and first quarter of 2002. The Euro area economies have not succeeded in the maintenance of the growth pace and also show deceleration. The Japanese economy still does not show signs of resurgence. In Latin America, the economies are suffering from the weak performance of main world economies and from the rising uncertainty towards Argentina. In this context, East Asian countries have also been strongly affected by the reduction of the level of world demand, but they are less internally imbalanced than they were in 1997 and 1998.
In the United States, the demand maintains its decelerating trend, although at a lower pace. In June retail sales recorded the sixth positive monthly variation out of the last seven months. However, the trajectory of the accumulated 12-month variation remains waning, similarly to orders to industries and commencement of housing construction. The pace of export and, mainly, import growth reduced, decreasing the trade deficit between October 2000 and April 2001.
In this context, first quarter GDP grew by 1.2%, annualized, compared to the fourth quarter of 2000, in the seasonally adjusted series. Industrial production contracted for the ninth consecutive month, showing accumulated 12-month growth of 2.1% comparatively to an expansion of 5.9% in October 2000. The inflation rate remained stable, considering the 3.62% annual variation of consumer prices in May and of the 2.53% increase in producer prices in June. This outlook drove the Federal Reserve to reduce fed funds in 0.25 percentage point in June, reaching 3.75% p.a., emphasising the weakness of the economy. Indicators of executives’ expectations signal improvements in the next months, with rise in NAPM indicators for both the processing and non-processing sectors and in Conference Board Leading Indicators. 
The Euro Area economic performance still points to a loss of dynamism, while consumer price inflation continued on the upward trend. Annual expansion of retail sales dropped to 1.5% in April from 2.1% in March. After a slight recovery in the first quarter, the trade balance recorded a deficit of US$ 2.7 billion in April, with imports annual variation of 11.62% overcoming exports annual variation of 7.31%. Industrial production showed negative monthly variation in March and April, reducing annual expansion to 1.6% in April from 2.9% in March. The annualized harmonized price index increased to 3.4% in April, from 2.6% in February and March, above the 2% reference level established by the European Central Bank (BCE) since June 2000. On its last meeting, the BCE decided to maintain the basic interest rate at 4.5% pa. Entrepreneurs’ expectations in the three main countries of the region still indicate a downward trend.
In Argentina, macroeconomics fundamentals still point to a waning economic activity. Supermarket and shopping centers sales dropped in May comparatively to the same period of last year, as did civil construction. As to the external sector, the trade balance recorded a surplus of US$ 1.2 billion up to May 2001, similarly to the last year’s result. Supply indicators corroborate the recession environment. First quarter GDP fell by 0.2% compared to the previous quarter and industrial output declined by 1.3% in May compared to April. Fiscal Results still evidence difficulties in attaining the targets agreed with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The total deficit reached US$ 4.9 billion in May, US$ 39 million below the target set for the first half. 
The absence of recovery signs, the fiscal outlook, and the political crisis played a role in the severe worsening of the risk perception of the Argentine economy, elevating the yields on the Treasury Bills (Letes) auctioned. In this context, the government announced the fiscal policy program to reach a zero deficit. This program included measures to reduce public workers salaries and to increase the rate of the Financial Transactions Tax. However, uncertainties regarding political support to the program still have not promoted substantial changes in the path of domestic interest rates and of Argentina’s sovereign risk.
The prior COPOM meeting’s decision to increase the Selic rate target by 150 points and to indicate a downward bias, conjugated with the announcement, in the day after the meeting, of measures related to the foreign exchange market and the balance of payments led, at the first moment, to a reduction of the slope of the interest rate curve for short tenures. The spread between the threemonth rate and the Selic rate decreased to 190 points from 410 points. It was also observed a downward parallel movement in the curve, of approximately 80 points, for higher tenures. Due to the aggravation of the uncertainties in Argentina, the curve started to present successive upward movements. The last movement, between July 3rd and July 16th, showed a strong increase in the curve slope of tenures lower than 90 days: the spread between the DI Future for October (most liquid maturity) and the Selic rate increased to 660 points from 340 points. 
Of the six public auctions of NBCE settled between June 20th and July 17th, three of them were placed with one-year maturity, two with two-year maturity and one with five-year maturity. The average rates ranged from 8.32% p.a. and 13.20% p.a.. The average demand/supply ratios were of 1.7 for the auctions designed to rollover the debt and 1.5 for hedge demand. It should be stressed that the demand/supply ratio decreased to 1.2 in the last offer on July 12th. 
Three selling offers of fixed income securities, with five-month tenure, were placed between June 20th and July 17th. The average rates were 22.02% p.a. in the first auction, 20.70% p.a. in the second and 21.88% in the last one. The total amount settled reached R$ 5.6 billion and the average demand/supply ratio was of 1.7. At the beginning of July, the National Treasury decided to temporarily interrupt the sales of LTN due to the increase of volatility observed in the market’s interest rates. 
The four auctions of LFT settled in the period totaled R$ 17.8 billion. The securities were offered with five-year tenure and increasing average discounts between 0.14% p.a. and 0.29% p.a.. In the COPOM meeting’s day, July 18th, the LFTs auctioned out on the eve were settled, the five-year securities being fully sold with an average discount of 0.31% p.a., reaching a financial amount of R$ 3.5 billion. 
The average tenure of issuance of federal securities reduced to 32.4 months in June from 43.8 months in May. This reduction is related to the increase in the volume of NBCE placements, especially with one-year tenure, and of five-month LTN, in addition to the reduction of NTN-C auctions’ tenure to 7 years, in average, in June, from 20 years in May. 
In the same period, the average maturity of the securitized debt grew to 35.2 months from 33.6 months. This rise was due to the significant volume of LFT redeemed, which was practically entirely rolled over, through public offers with 61-month tenures and, through direct issues (Banco do Brasil and Caixa Econômica Federal) with 41-month tenures. Among the holders of federal securities, financial institutions portfolio started to have a higher participation in the total domestic securities in the market in July, in detriment of the Financial Investment Funds (FIFs). In mid-July, financial institutions participated with 41% of the total, compared to 38% of FIFs’ participation. This was due to the net redemptions in FIFs’ portfolios in May, June and July and to the direct placements of LFT to Banco do Brasil and Caixa Econômica Federal in June and July. 
Identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed in light of newly available information. The scenario considered in the simulations is based on the following hypotheses:
1. June’s inflation rate, measured by the IPCA, reached 0.52%, slightly above the expected (0.46%),
2. Considering the price schedule implied by Brent crude oil futures contracts, the expectation for the average price of the barrel in the third quarter of 2001 was reduced to US$25.5 in the third quarter and US$25.0 in the last quarter of 2001. From 2002 on, the hypothesis is that these prices shall follow market’s inflation rate, 
3. The projection for the electric energy tariffs’ readjustment in 2001 remained at 20%. For the set of administered prices, including fuel, energy, public transportation, IPTU and domestic employment, the expected total readjustment remained practically unaltered at 13%, which represents a direct contribution of 2.9 percentage points to the 2001 inflation, 
4. The hypothesis for the slope of the interest rate curve lies at 575 base points in the third quarter of 2001, linearly declining to 235 base points in the third quarter of 2002, 5. The hypothesis for the path of the Fed Funds rate is of a drop from its average level up to the end of the year, with a gradual elevation up to the second half of 2002, and stability thereafter,   
6. On the external front, the increase of uncertainties is assumed to elevate the average of Brazil risk premium in the third quarter of 2001 for levels prevailing before this Copom meeting, subsequent reductions being expected in the following quarters, stabilizing in the 600 base points level.
Regarding the net effects of electricity shock on the inflation rate, modeled based on the impact on the aggregate demand and supply, the previous assumptions were maintained. 
The IPCA core, calculated under the symmetric trimmed-mean method, rose in June to 0.73%, due to increases distributed among several product categories. Accumulated in 12 months, the core index increased by 6.22%. The IPC-BR core, released by Fundação Getúlio Vargas, elevated to 0.56% in May from 0.52% in April, accumulating a 4.75% increase in 12 months. 
The median of market expectations for the IPCA, as surveyed by the Central Bank on a daily basis, was revised to 6.00% from 5.50% for 2001 and to 4.00% from 3.82% for 2002. 
The remaining assumptions established in the previous meeting were maintained. It shall be stressed that the fiscal performance has been granting the achievement of the primary fiscal surpluses above to the established fiscal targets. 
Regarding the exchange rate, a slightly upward trajectory from the day prior to the Copom meeting was considered. 
Simulation exercises with the scenario considered in the basic (structural) model leads to the conclusion that the maintenance of the interest rate at the current level of 18.25% per year would result in inflation near the upper limit of the target for 2001. However, for 2002 the projected inflation is below the 3.5% target. 
The fall of pace of demand growth was accentuated at the end of the second quarter and beginning of the third quarter, revealed by recently announced commerce indicators. The real invoicing of the retailing sector of the Region Metropolitan of São Paulo declined by 6.2% in June 2001 compared  to the same month of the previous year. The National Index of Consumer’s expectation decreased significantly by 7.1% in the second quarter. The deceleration in the economic activity reflects the effect of a sequence of shocks that impacted the Brazilian economy, such as the cooling of global economy growth, the Argentina crisis and the electric energy shocks. 
The unraveling of these shocks along the past weeks deserves attention. The management of the use of electric energy has been successful, with companies and consumers demonstrating considerable advances in the process of rationalization of its use. There are signs that the negative effect of the rationing of energy upon the economy’s supply may be less than expected. As a result, the cooling of the growth pace in the past months shall have been driven by a fall in demand and not by reduced supply, given the effects of the various shocks on consumers’ expectations. In Argentina, in spite of the implementation of a set of measures aiming at improving public accounts, the profile of the public debt and the competitiveness of the economy, the risk premiums in the financial market remain high. 
Bank loans are still growing, yet at a lower pace than previously observed, but still significantly. Inasmuch as the decelerating growth of the demand for goods and services has been more pronounced, continued expansion in banking loans may be reflecting credit substitution - among others, foreign or domestic non-banking loans by domestic loans extended by the banking sector. In this case, current credit growth shall not be posing additional pressures upon inflation. 
The depreciation of the exchange rate since the beginning of the year may be attributed to the diverse external and domestic shocks the economy has experienced and to the perception of a worsening in the balance of payments. In this sense, although the likelihood that the formation of the exchange rate entails a parcel of proper dynamics is not rejected, the perception that the observed behavior of the exchange rate is tied to fundamentals, some being temporary, is becoming predominant. In order to strengthen balance of payments financing, the Central Bank decided to announce the sale of US$6.0 billion, conducted uniformly until the end of the year, not violating the principles that guide the floating exchange rate regime, which are based on the continuity of the monetary and exchange policies in place.
The potential passthrough to prices is one of the reasons justifying monetary policy reaction, translated into increases in interest rates to neutralize this effect. Even though overall inflation projections have been revised upwards, they have not been following the speed of exchange rate depreciation, what is in line with the expectation that a share of this depreciation will not be transmitted to consumer prices. In fact, the IPCA accumulated a 2.96% increase in the first half of 2001, mostly influenced by the evolution of food and administered prices, as tradables recorded smaller variations.
In spite of that, core inflation as measured under the symmetric trimmed-mean methodology, has increased in the past months. The analysis of the items composing the core inflation in June points to a generalized pressure on prices, distributed among many product categories. In this sense, it is important that the monetary policy remain vigilant so as to avoid the propagation, in 2001 and 2002, of price realignments resulting from the shocks and exchange rate devaluation.
In sum, Copom concluded that the pressures on inflation, the increase of the core inflation in the past months and the risk of passthrough to inflation, also via administered prices, recommend a tightening in monetary policy by means of an increase in interest rate, so as to ensure convergence of inflation to the targeted trajectory.
"
03/09/2001;62;Arminio Fraga;"Recent data on the economic activity level have confirmed the continuity of the process of economic deceleration commencing at the end of the first quarter. This mirrors the evolution of the international economy scenario in addition to the impacts of the energy crisis, and its effects on the interest and exchange rates. 
Such factors impacted economic agents’ expectations. The deterioration of entrepreneurs' and consumers’ expectations throughout the second quarter of the year triggered demand indicators to more intensively reflect this adjustment path of the economy, showing negative variation both in the seasonally adjusted monthly results and in the comparisons with the same months of the previous year. 
The information on the retail activity in São Paulo, released by the Trade Federation of the State of São Paulo (FCESP), illustrates this evolution. In July, still with preliminary data, a 5.5% fall was observed in the seasonally adjusted series, the fifth consecutive one, accumulating negative variation of 1.7% in the year. Compared to the same period of 2000, in the first three months of the year the retail sales in São Paulo expanded, reverting to show negative results from April until July. 
The overall evolution of the retail commerce mainly reflects the weak performance, in the year, of the durable goods segment (-2.8%) and the autovehicles commerce (-11%), according to FCESP. However, the retail sales of autovehicles have presented accentuated oscillations in the monthly outcomes as a result of peculiar features, such as sales promotions to reduce inventory. In the past monthly results, special notice should be attributed to the distinct evolution of supermarket, pharmacy and perfumery sales, with some recovery in June and July after falling in May. A survey carried out at a national stance by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) also confirms the lower pace of the retail activity in the year. Available information for the first semester indicates that the volume of retail sales declined by 0.9% compared to the same period of 2000. 
The Consumer Intentions Index (IIC), also measured by FCESP, retreated once again in August, reaching 89.9, still within the pessimistic band (below 100, in a 0 to 200 scale). Noteworthy was the distinct evolution of its two components, with current intentions posing some recovery, possibly due to the perception that the effects of the energy rationing were not so drastic as previously expected, and with future intentions declining once more, associated with more pessimistic expectations due to the reduction of the real income and to the worsened conditions of consumer credit. 
Second quarter GDP figures, released by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), confirmed the deceleration of the activity level, with a 0.99% fall (seasonally adjusted series) compared to the first quarter of the year. Even though the direction of the GDP evolution could be anticipated, given the presence of factors unfavorable to the economic conjuncture in the second quarter, the magnitude of the reduction was larger than expected. Among other factors, the weak performance of the processing industry and communications were pointed out as the main drivers of the frustration of the expectations concerning the GDP evolution in the period. With this result, a 2.5% growth was achieved in the first semester, comparatively to 2000, as a consequence of positive performance in all sectors, under the same comparison basis.
To a large extent, the GDP outcome reflected the evolution of the industrial sector. According to the Monthly Industrial Survey carried out by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), the industrial production fell for the fourth consecutive month, by 1.2% in the seasonally adjusted series. Among the categories, an expressive reduction was observed in the production of durable consumer goods and intermediate goods. In the semester, the industrial production expanded by 4.9% compared to the same period in the previous year, although in June the production level was lower than in the same month of 2000, interrupting a sequence of positive variation commencing in August 1999. 
The retreat in industrial production led to a lower usage of installed capacity, as reported by both the National Confederation of Industries (CNI) survey in June, with 80.1% compared to 81.1% in May, seasonally adjusted data, and the Processing Industry Conditions Survey in July carried out by Fundação Getúlio Vargas (FGV), with 81.1% compared to 83.9% in the previous survey (April). Worked hours in the production reduced by 1.2% in June, CNI's seasonally adjusted series, indicating the preference for this alternative in adjusting production in the short run in relation to position cuts, what has been confirmed by labor market data. 
In fact, employment indicators have evolved more favorably than expected. Thus, the unemployment rate was of 6.38% in June, from 6.86% in May, reflecting the hiring of 57 thousand workers in the surveyed metropolitan regions along with the 35 thousand reduction in the employable population (PEA). Information from the Ministry of Labor and Employment confirmed the favorable evolution in the job market in June. In regard to formal employment, monthly figures showed a 0.15% growth (seasonally adjusted series), mainly in the services and commerce sectors. In the manufacturing sector, however, industrial surveys indicated trend reversal, with the number of positions being reduced in June. 
According to the Industrial Confidence Index, released on a quarterly basis by CNI, the perspective for the industry for the next months is not favorable. Surveyed on a quarterly basis, the indicator declined in July, basically motivated by the energy crisis and persistent hikes in the exchange and interest rates. Nevertheless, the companies' process of adapting to the new conditions in order to counteract restrictions imposed by the crisis (via installation of electric energy generators and the intensification of transactions in the wholesale market, among others) tend to evolve positively, compared to the conditions observed at the beginning of the energy rationing period. 
The outstanding banking credit stock grew by 1.8% in July. In the same period, the stock of non-earmarked operations elevated by 2%, due to a 2.4% increase in the operations with corporations and 1.4% in the operations carried out with the individuals segment. This performance was due to interest accrued to the stock of operations previously settled, as new concessions fell significantly as to the daily average concession to both corporations and households, by 4.9% and 9.1%, respectively. The evolution of new operations reflects contained demand for consumption and investment, given the rise of credit costs and higher selectivity of financial institutions, associated with the rise of uncertainties and default rates. 
Concerning fixed-rate credit operations contracted with the individuals segment, the ratio of credit in arrears increased in the last quarter to reach 6.5% in July (15 to 90 days in arrears) and to 4.9% (above 90 days in arrears). According to the Credit Protection Service of the São Paulo Trade Association (ACSP), the net rate of default reached 7.3% in July, contributing to a 8.7% average in the year from 6.3% recorded in the same period of 2000. The ratio of number of checks returned due to insufficient funds and cleared reached 5.1% in July, with a 5.8% average in the year, 30% higher than in the same period of 2000. 
The trade balance recorded a US$ 108 million surplus in July, accumulating a US$ 38 million surplus in the year. Nonetheless, both exports and imports decreased in July, considering daily averages, remaining on the downward trend of growth commencing in May, compared to the same period of 2000. 
In July, exports decreased mainly due to semi-manufactured products, led by pulp, iron, steel and crude aluminum, products more directly affected by the electric energy rationing. The shipment of soy and soy bran in July was hindered by strong rains in the region of the Paranaguá Harbor, the main soy shipment harbor in Brazil, causing shipped volumes to fall if compared to July 2000. In August, the shipment of soy returned to normal conditions. It shall be stressed the continuity of increased shipment of exported chicken meat, beef and pork meat, raw tobacco and corn, the latter not exported in 2000 due to problems in the harvest. 
Regarding imports, only durable consumer goods rose in July, especially due to increased imports of auto-vehicles. Reflecting the cooling of the domestic industrial growth, imports of raw material and intermediate products fell, in particular transportation equipment and accessories, and, to a smaller degree, capital goods. 
Relatively to investments in the country, the index which takes into account domestic absorption of capital goods and production of inputs to the civil construction declined at the end of the first half of 2001, even though indices accumulated in 2001 still show growth. Accordingly, the estimates for the gross fixed capital formation as a share of GDP reached 19.3% in June 2001 (accumulated in the last twelve months) from 18.4% in June 2000. It shall be noticed that the production of capital goods for the electric energy generation continued to grow, accumulating a 40.1% expansion in the first half of 2001. 
To conclude, the activity level in the last months reflects the agents’ reaction to the electric energy crisis and to adverse shocks arising from the international scenario. The mechanisms to adjust to these shocks should be mentioned. Firstly, the fast and substantial worsening of expectations which highly impacted consumption expenditures, especially regarding the items sensitive to credit, which require commitment of future income. This fact, associated with high interest rates and the perspective of a deepening of the Argentina crisis, reflected in the industrial output and investment flows. Nonetheless, three positive aspects should be noticed in this picture. The first one is related to the evolution of employment indicators, which, although mirror adverse shocks, do so discretely. The second refers to price evolution, not evidencing generalized hikes as a consequence of supply shocks, as previously speculated. The last one refers to the recovery of the trade balance, although incipient. 
Administered price readjustments, partially influenced by the exchange rate devaluation, were the main factors to determine the evolution of inflation in July. Food prices also influenced the index, by continuously reflecting off-season effects and the impact of the exchange rate variation in some items, such as soybean oil and wheat by products. 
The IPCA rose by 1.33% in July, accumulating an increase of 4.32% in 2001 and 7.05% in the last twelve months. The non-food products segment increased by 1.52% in the month, mostly influenced by the rise in gasoline prices and cooking gas and by the readjustment in urban bus tariffs, in the electric energy in São Paulo and Curitiba and in fixed telephony throughout the country. As a consequence of these hikes, the administered prices solely contributed to 0.9 percentage point of the monthly variation of the IPCA. 
The IGP-DI recorded a 1.62% variation in July, compared to 1.46% in June, accumulating 6.43% in 2001 and 10.78% in the last twelve months. The 1.93% variation in the IPA – Wholesale Price Index, practically stable as compared to the 1.96% variation in June, was the main factor determining the evolution of the IGP-DI. The evolution of the IPA reflected, notably, the recent exchange rate devaluation, with special notice to monthly results in “crops for exports” and “oleaginous”, among the agricultural products, and "oil and grease”, "flower and by-products” and "fuel and lubricants", among the industrial others. 
The decelerating pace of US economic activity does not show signs of reversal in the short run, contributing to the dissemination of the economic deceleration in other countries. In this context, the Euro Area presents signs of deceleration, with the possibilities of a Japanese economic recovery in the short run tending to be minimized. The emerging economies are affected both by the direct negative impact of the reduction of the external demand and by unfavorable change in the risk perception of international investors. 
Official forecasts of the US GDP performance show an expansion of 0.7% in the second quarter, relatively to the previous one, in the seasonally adjusted series and annual variation, reflecting the adjustment of industrial inventory and reductions in the pace of exports and consumption. The domestic demand remains on a downward trajectory, with the retail sales, orders to industries and consumer credit decreasing in July by 0.1%, 2.4%, and 0.1%, respectively, compared to the previous month in the seasonally adjusted series. The investments tend to remain contracted, with the production of capital goods decreasing during the first seven months of 2001 and the orders of new telecommunication equipment and computers significantly negative in June. The unfavorable expectations of entrepreneurs and consumers signal, in conjunction with the other analyzed indicators, the trend of delayed economic recovery relatively to initial expectations. 
The industrial production fell in July, for the tenth consecutive month, reducing the expansion accumulated in the last twelve months to 1.7%, after reaching 5.9% in October 2000. Although the adjustment of inventory levels, expressively high in 2000, has been partially realized, the perspectives of increased production are small, since the expectations of demand growth are fragile, reflecting the deterioration of the labor market, the contraction of corporate profits and the deceleration of the activity pace of other countries, which negatively influences exports. The wholesale and consumer price indices in July presented negative variation, which may be associated with the evolution of international energy prices and the domestic price of gasoline, as well with the reduction of the demand. 
The Euro Area economies have shown a reducing trend in the growth rates of retail sales, what has contributed, jointly with the performance of exports, to the contraction of the industrial production. Therefore, industrial output decreased in four of the first six months of the year, 1.4% higher than the same period of the previous year. The weaker performance of these economies has reflected in the descending trajectory of price indices, which have also been responding to lower oil prices. In this context, the confidence indicators of the three main economies follow on a descending path, reaching 90 in Germany (IFO) and 93 in Italy (ISAE) in June, and 99 in France in July, after reaching 92, 95 and 102, respectively, in the previous month. 
The Japanese economy remains with no signs of recovery. In June, the orders to the industries contracted by 18.7% relatively to the previous month, seasonally adjusted series, with the construction sector index falling by 10.5% compared to the same month in 2000. The external trade balance reached US$ 5.3 billion in June, 50% lower than in the same month of 2000, with contracting trend in exports and deterioration of the balance, considering accumulated figures in the last 12 months. The industrial production fell by 0.7% in June, the fifth reduction in the first half of the year, 8.7% lower than the level achieved in June 2000. As a consequence of this scenario, the Central Bank of Japan increased the liquidity of the Financial System to ¥6 trillion from ¥5 trillion in the meeting of August 14, along with the increase of long-term public securities purchases to ¥600 billion from ¥400 billion per month. It shall be stressed that the yen has shown appreciating trend vis-a-vis the American dollar inasmuch as the perspectives for longer deceleration in US become more evident. 
In sum, despite the actions implemented aiming to revert the decelerating scenario of economic activity in industrial countries, no clear signs of reversal until the end of this year can be observed. 
In Argentina, the congress approved the zero deficit program and the government still tries to preserve the credibility in its capacity to recover economy growth. Demand and production indicators do not reveal the retrieval of economic activity, although the fiscal result of June positively contributed to the accomplishment of the target agreed with the IMF in December. It shall be emphasized that the US$ 767 million trade balance in June, accumulating a surplus of US$ 2 billion in the first half of the year, compared to a positive balance of US$ 1.2 billion in 2000. This result reflects the 6% expansion of exports and the 19% reduction in imports. 
Copom's decision in the prior meeting to increase the Over-Selic target by 75 basis points did not lead to significant changes in the slope of the interest rate curve. Afterwards, the announcement of the new agreement with the IMF and the release of data indicating deceleration in the economic activity translated into the main reasons for the downward move of the slope of the interest rate curve. In the period between July 16 and August 20, a significant reduction was observed in the interest curve slope in regard to tenures shorter than 90 days. The spread between the Over-Selic rate and the Futures DI to October reduced to 140 bp from 660 bp, reverting the expectations of an eventual interest rate shock in the short run. For tenures higher than 180 days, the spread reached approximately 150 bp. 
In regard to exchange rate pegged securities, the Central Bank of Brazil maintained the strategy of integrally rolling over principal and final interest payments. In the beginning of August, the Central Bank offered one-year securities to roll over redemptions amounting to R$ 1.1 billion. For the R$ 5.2 billion redemption in August 16, three five-year NBC-E offers were carried out (totaling 68% of that volume) and one last offer of one-year securities, after the demand for such securities had evidenced saturation for longer tenures. The average yields for the one-year NBC-E reached 7.62% and 6.38% p.a.. For the five-year securities, average yields were of 12% p.a.
The five LFT offers placed between July 19 and August 22 totaled R$12 billion, with the average demand over offer ratio reaching 1.25. The securities were auctioned at five-year tenures and showed increasing trend in the maximum discounts over face values, from 0.34% to 0.42% p.a.. 
Resulting from improvements in the expectations due to the new IMF agreement, the National Treasury resumed the placements of fixed rate securities at the beginning of August. In this context, there were three offers of five-month fixed rate securities. R$3.2 billion were settled with the average demand over offer ratio achieving 2.2. 
In regard to the financial settlements between July 18 and August 21, a R$10.5 billion expansionist monetary impact was observed in the period, determined by operations with National Treasury securities. Noteworthy were the net redemptions of R$5.7 billion in LTN and R$4.2 billion in LFT. 
Within a 25 working day period, the Central Bank intervened six times in the open market, aiming at administering the short-term interest rate. In five of those interventions, the Central Bank carried out sales of federal securities with repurchase agreements, at maximum yields of 18.90% p.a., with the average volume of the interventions reaching R$3.5 billion. The remaining operation constituted a purchase of federal securities, with a resale agreement, of R$4.0 billion at the minimum rate of 19.05% p.a. 
The identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed in light of newly available information. The scenario considered in the simulations encompasses the following hypotheses: 
1. July inflation rate, measured by the IPCA, reached 1.33%, slightly above the expected, 
2. considering the price schedule implied by Brent crude oil futures contracts, the expectations for the average price of the barrel were reduced to US$ 24.9 in the third quarter of 2001 and to US$ 24.5 in the fourth quarter. After 2002, the hypothesis that the prices of oil by-products in the domestic market shall follow market inflation is considered,
3. the definition of administered prices was altered to include a wider set of items, weighting 29.9% of the IPCA (formerly, the projection was based on a set weighting 22.6%, which basically included items to which projections were more straightforward). For this set of prices, the expected readjustment in 2001 remained relatively stable at 10% for August, from 10.5% in July. Such prices accumulate a 6.7% variation from January to July with further 3.1% being expected for the remaining of the year. The evolution of these prices is expected to directly contribute with 2.9% for the year inflation, compared to the 3.0% estimated in July, 
4. the forecast for the readjustment of electrical energy tariffs in 2001 remained at 20%, 
5. the slope of the domestic yield curve – defined as the difference between the 180 day swap rate and the one day Selic rate - is forecasted at an average below 500 basis points in the third quarter of 2001, linearly declining to an average slightly above 200 basis points in the second quarter of 2002, with stability thereafter, 
6. the hypothesis for the path of the Fed Funds interest rate was altered to incorporate a reducing trajectory in the average rate until the end of the year and a slight increase after the second quarter of 2002, accordingly to the futures market projections for the rate, 
7. on the external front, the hypothesis for the average risk premium – measured as the difference between the adjusted yield of Brazil’s Global Bonds and the United States Treasury Bonds, both with approximate duration of 4 years – was revised to incorporate a declining trajectory from current levels to a plateau near 600 points after the second quarter of 2002. 
The hypotheses reflect in an exchange rate stable around current levels for 2001 and a gradual appreciation in 2002. 
The IPCA core, calculated under the symmetric trimmed-mean method, slightly declined to 0.65% in July. Accumulated in 12 months, the core index increased by 6.3%. The inflation core calculated with the exclusion of administered and food prices increased by 0.49% in July, with 4.0% accumulated variation in 12 months as of July, compared to 3.78% in the previous month. 
The median of market expectations for the IPCA, as surveyed by the Central Bank on a daily basis, was revised to 6.3% from 6.0% for 2001 and to 4.5% from 4.0% for 2002. 
The fiscal accounts have overperformed the targets currently set for the fiscal policy and is in line with the new proposal of a 3.35% of GDP primary surplus in 2001 and 3.5% in 2002. 
The remaining assumptions established in the previous meeting were maintained. 
Simulation exercises with the scenario considered in the basic (structural) model leads to the conclusion that the maintenance of the interest rate at the current level of 19.0% p.a. would result in inflation slightly above 6% for 2001. However, for 2002 the projected inflation is below the 3.5% target.
Recent data and other indicators regarding the activity level have confirmed the continuity, in the last months, of the cooling economic trend observed since the end of the first quarter. This reflects the impact of both the international scenario and the energy crisis on expectations and domestic economy. 
The contribution of each of the various factors to the economic deceleration is difficult to be assessed. Nonetheless, the reduction in the aggregate demand seems to have been the main factor to respond for the worsening economic performance, if compared to the restriction imposed to aggregate supply stemming from the energy crisis. The reduction in the demand may be explained by the worsening of the external scenario, by the reflex of the energy shortage on the expectations and by the recent tightening of the monetary policy. The perception that the deceleration of the world economy shall be longer than forecasted in the beginning of the year, in conjunction with the evolution of the Argentina crisis have contributed to the downward revision of expectations concerning the Brazilian economic growth, with negative impacts on the aggregate demand. These expectations were also influenced by the energy crisis, which affected entrepreneurs’ and consumers’ confidence. Monetary policy actions, in addition to the direct impact of the interest rate hikes on the demand, also reflected in market's expectations, as revealed by the steepening of the slope of the interest rate curve since last March. The shift in expectations accelerated the impact of the monetary policy. This cooling in the demand may pose downward pressure to the inflation rate in 2001 and 2002. 
Notwithstanding the fall in inflation expected in the near future due to the scenario of economic deceleration, the response of the exchange rate continues to be a source of concern. There are still risks of an exchange rate passthrough to domestic prices stemming from accumulated depreciation since the beginning of the year. These risks become more intense as the depreciation starts to be perceived as permanent and the demand recovers. 
In the short run, uncertainties concerning the exchange rate market have not been dissipated. In the medium run, given the transitory nature of the shocks and economic policy reaction, it is reasonable to assume that an improvement in the Balance of Payments will materialize. Moreover, in order to reduce the impact of the unfavorable international conjuncture and its eventual adverse impacts on the economy, the Brazilian government counts with a new IMF program contemplating US$$15 billion in financial resources. 
The core inflation remains at a high level, although having presented some decline. The analysis of the items incorporated into the calculation of the core inflation in July points out to a pressure on prices, distributed among various categories of products. In 2001, the IPCA accumulated a 4.32% variation until July, led by administered prices evolution (6.7%, with a contribution of 2% for the IPCA). Free prices increased by 3.3% (with a contribution of 2.4% for the IPCA), with food prices rising by 5.1% (with a contribution of 0.9% for the IPCA). Inflation expectations may stabilize. The IPCA accumulated variation and the forecast of the contribution of administered prices to the index in the remainder of the year (0.92%) indicate that the inflation will be slightly above 6% in 2001. For 2002, the forecasts generated from various simulation exercises within Central Bank's structural model, considering a constant interest rate trajectory, indicate an inflation rate comfortably below the target. 
Copom concluded that, if on the one hand the cooling economic activity impose downward pressure onto inflation forecasts, yet to be confirmed, on the other hand, the increase of the core inflation in the last months and the existing risks of passthrough pressures, inclusively via administered prices, recommend caution on managing the monetary policy. Under these circumstances, Copom decided that the monetary policy is currently adequate to assure convergence of the inflation to the targets.
"
28/09/2001;63;Arminio Fraga;"
Domestic economic activity continues to indicate deceleration, following the trend observed since the end of the first quarter. This has been reflecting the deterioration in the external economic situation and the energy crisis and, the resulting impact on expectations and on the behavior of interest and exchange rates. 
The demand indicators exhibited relative stability in August and September, partly due to their prompt and stronger response to the changes in the economic environment. Nevertheless, the signs are still incipient to affirm that the deceleration process is near the end. In addition, the repercussion of the attacks to the U.S.A. has not yet reflected in the economic indicators released so far. It shall be stressed, however, that the likely unraveling of this crisis creates new uncertainties regarding the external economic environment, which is unfavorable for recovery in the domestic economic activity in the current circumstances. 
Preliminary data released by the Trade Federation of the State of São Paulo (FCESP), showed that the retailers turnover in the Metropolitan Region of São Paulo increased by 1% in August compared to July, but accumulated a 3% drop year-to-date compared to the same period of 2000. The outcome in August was affected by the 7.2% increase in the sales of construction material, which offset the 1.3% decline in the sales of consumer goods and 8.3% in the auto-vehicle sales. 
The Consumer Intentions Index (IIC), also measured by FCESP, partially recovered in September to reach 94.9, still within the pessimistic range – below 100, in a 0 to 200 scale. This recovery featured the positive evolution of both components, current and future intentions, mirroring a less negative perception of domestic economic and political environment at the end of August, when the survey was carried out. Therefore, the result in September still does not reflect the repercussion of the attacks to the U.S.A. on the formation of domestic expectations. 
The overall investment indicators in the country exhibited signs of cooling in July, mainly regarding imports and exports of capital goods, whereas domestic production of capital goods still showed some dynamism, geared by the effects of the energy rationing, which bolstered the production of energy generation equipments. The production of raw material for the building industry leveled off in the month, after plunging in the previous bimester. 
The industrial production decelerated for the fifth consecutive month in July, with a 1.2% decline in the seasonally adjusted series. In the year, the industrial production grew by 4.3%, with the accumulated change reaching 5.1% in the twelve months to July, from 5.7% in June. In the month, negative growth was observed in 13 of a total of 20 industrial sectors and 3 of the 4 usage categories. Positive growth was observed solely in the production of capital goods. Noteworthy, in the two first months under the energy rationing program, the industrial production diminished by 0.1% compared to the same months last year, as a result of the 4.7% reduction in the production of durable consumer goods and 1.6% in intermediate goods. Considering the intensity of electrical energy expenditures, highly intensive sectors cut down on production by 10.1% in the June-July period, whereas medium and low intensive sectors expanded by 4.4% and 4%, respectively, compared to the same period of 2000.
The weaker performance in industrial production resulted in a new reduction of productive capacity, as surveyed by the National Confederation of Industries (CNI), reaching 79.7% in July in the seasonally adjusted basis. It was the fifth consecutive drop since the recent 82% peak observed in February 2001. Working hours in the production reduced by 1.5% in July, in the seasonally adjusted basis, as reported by CNI, revealing that the overtime cuts and the collective vacation have constituted the preferred alternative as compared to job cuts to adjust to deceleration in t industrial activity. Notwithstanding, industrial surveys indicate reduction in employment in this sector. The unemployment rate reached 6.19% in July, versus 6.38% in June, though as a result of reduction of 49 thousand positions and of 91 thousand people in the employable population (PEA). 
Regarding credit operations, the outstanding stock of free resources increased by 2.4% in August, due to a 2.6% increase in the operations with corporations and 2.1% with households. This performance, however, continued to reflect a positive flow resulting from transactions settled previously, as new loans fell for the second consecutive month, a response to the environment of uncertainties together with the maintenance of lending rates on an upward trend. The daily average of credit concession to corporations and households dropped by 6.1% and 1.3% in August, respectively, compared to the previous month. 
On the fiscal front, the increase of the primary surplus to R$ 34.4 billion up to September confirms the maintenance of austerity. In August, collection of taxes and contributions remained at a growing pace, mainly due to the effects of tax collection on capital income and financial turnover, as tax collection on corporate revenue has been growing at a lower pace, reflecting the deceleration of the economic activity. 
As to the external transactions of the Brazilian economy, the trade balance recorded a US$ 663 million surplus in August and a US$ 120 million surplus on the first two weeks of September, accumulating a positive result of US$ 779 million year to date. Noteworthy, after May, exports and imports started to grow at lower rates, reflecting, simultaneously, but at a different intensity, the effects of deceleration in the Brazilian and global economies. 
In August, exports was improved by aircraft re-exports, similarly to August 2000, although growth in sales of basic products continued to be remarkable, mainly poultry, beef and pork, together with the recovery in exports of semi-manufactured products, resulting from the recovery in sales of iron and steel products and the continuing sugar export growth. Shipment of manufactured products fell once again compared to the same month of 2000. As to market destination, the best results were achieved with countries holding a smaller share of Brazilian exports, confirming the diversification of destination of Brazilian sales in 2001, at the same time as the sales to the main markets, United States and Mercosur, slowed. 
Regarding total import volumes, purchases of capital goods were the sole segment to increase comparing to August 2000. In terms of daily average volumes , only the acquisition of fuel and oil surpassed August 2000 results. The reduction in purchases of consumption and intermediate goods reflects the slower industrial output growth in the country and the recent depreciation of the exchange rate. 
To conclude, the deterioration in the external front and the adjustment of the economy to the energy crisis triggered a process deceleration in economic activity, which is still on. As a result, the observed and projected growth rates for the Brazilian economy for 2001 is lower. The labor market is starting to adjust, albeit gradually, to this environment, which shall exert additional pressure to the real wage bill, already affected by the impact from administered price adjustments. The deterioration of credit conditions, with more selectivity, shorter maturities and higher interest rates, does not favor demand recovery. The fiscal position remains favorable, yet with prospect for continued decelerating revenue growth. The recent trend in trade suggests recovery of surpluses, mainly reflecting the downward trend of imports inasmuch as the international environment, even prior to the attacks to the United States, was unfavorable for exports . 
To evaluate the world economic outlook after the attacks to the United States on September 11 is more difficult as it tends to be tightly linked to the impact of such actions upon the North American economy. Although premature, the analysis is based on the acute expectation of unfavorable influence on consumer confidence and the prospects for deepening the slowing in the short run. This led the Federal Reserve to reduce basic interest rates by 50 bp, for the eighth time in the year, on September 17, currently standing at 3% . Alongside monetary loosening, the government signals the adoption of expansionary fiscal policy, partially using the primary surplus, which tends to produce positive impacts over the medium term, fostering the recovery stimulated by an easier monetary policy. 
Until early September, U.S. economy remained on a decelerating process and statistics released did not signal recovery in the short run. The consumption remained as the main pillar of demand, albeit on a downward trend, as investments decreased significantly since the end of 2000. The accentuated drop in investments has been recorded in the levels of inventory and fixed assets, such as facilities, machinery and software. It shall be stressed that this adjustment is considered relevant for the correction of imbalances impelled by the high growth period. The positive fiscal results have been inferior to initially expected, reflecting tax reduction, the change in collecting dates and the lower activity level. Trade has also been influenced by the deceleration growth , resulting in lower rates of import growth. Additionally, global repercussion of the fall in U.S. economic activity has translated into lower export growth rates. The evolution of price indices does not evidence existence of inflation pressures, enabling interest rate reduction. It shall be stressed that the expectations of manager's purchases (NAPM ) in the manufacturing sector had improved substantially in July, differently from the expectations of the managers in the services sector and consumers. 
In the Euro Area, statistics point to the contagion from the deceleration process in the United States. The Gross Domestic Product in the second quarter expanded by 1.7% relatively to the same period in the previous year, after a 2.4% rise in the first quarter. Country specific indicators relative to July and August and entrepreneurs' perception, translated into the fall in confidence indicators of the three major economies in the region – Germany, Italy and France-, suggest the maintenance of this trend in the next quarter. It shall be emphasized that, in coordination with the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank reduced basic interest rates by 50 basis points on September 17th, after which the main rediscount rate stood at 3.75% p.a. 
The Japanese economy remains with no signs of recovery in the activity level although the yen has been showing appreciation trend. Eastern Asian economies, which tend to present high dependence on both American and Japanese demand, are searching for measures to countervail external sector retraction, with China and South Korea featuring as the most successful. 
Latin American economies are undergoing the unfavorable impacts from the international markets via trade and tighter liquidity in financial markets, resulting in higher uncertainty and risk aversion from investors. The Argentine economy remains in recession, despite internal efforts and financial support programs by international financial institutions. 
In synthesis, the trend of cooling in economic activity is observed at a global level, led by the United States. This scenario tends to become deepen in the short run, as a function of the recrudescence of American consumer and corporate spending contraction, in response to the attacks on September 11. Nonetheless, the easing, already in progress, of monetary and fiscal policies in the United States should contribute to mitigate the contracting output trend in the medium term, with positive impacts for the world economy. 
In August, the adjustment of the administered prices continued to exert pressure on the main inflation indices, albeit at a lower intensity, thus contributing to lower monthly changes as compared to July. Considering consumer prices, electricity price adjustments in São Paulo, Curitiba and Belém, together with the rise of fuel prices at a national level put forth the most significant impact on the monthly outcome. As to wholesale prices, in addition to the impact from fuel prices, it shall be stressed the pressure from the increase in cereals and grains and crops for exports, among agricultural products, reflecting, in part, the effects of the exchange rate variation. 
The IPCA rose by 0.70% in August, compared to 1.33% in July, accumulating 5.06% in the year and 6.41% in the last twelve months. The retreat in the monthly outcome was due to the lesser impact of administered price adjustments, which concentrated in July. Food prices increased by 0.83%, geared by the 21% hike in soy oil prices, mostly led by the rise in international prices which had impacted wholesale prices in July. The impressive hikes in wheat flour, bread and pasta prices reflected both wheat price increases and the exchange rate variation. Still in the food sector, price increases were associated with off-season effects. The item domestic employee, which incremented by 2.38%, featured as the main individual contribution for the monthly variation (0,08 pp). This percentage reflects the variations in the labor market after the minimum wage adjustment in May. Regarding the item electricity , the 1.21% variation was a consequence of a 10.79% increase recorded in Belém, where the tariffs were readjusted by 14%, after August 7.
The IGP-DI rose by 0.9% in August, compared to 1.62% in July, accumulating 7.4% in the year and 9.8% in the last twelve months. The 1.13% variation in IPA was the main determinant of the IGP-DI result, whereas the IPC rose by 0.54%, still reflecting the hike in administered prices. The INCC increased by 0.62%, exclusively as a result of the hikes in civil construction prices inasmuch as labor costs remained stable. 
Based on the analysis of July and August indices, a conclusion may be drawn that the hikes observed stemmed from pressures arising from specific groups. A generalized rise among sectors is not evident, nor are continuous upward movements, which evinces the absence of indexation mechanisms in the economy. Taking into account this fact, together with the waning of pressures derived from administered price adjustments, a prospect for significant reduction in inflation rates is expected for the coming months. 
The trend of reduction in the slope of the interest rate yield curve continued some weeks after last Copom meeting, motivated by the interpretation that the 19% Over-Selic target would be an interest rate ceiling and by the favorable news on the external front?increase in the Purchasing Manager's Index (NAPM) in August, indicating smaller retraction in the activity level, and tax collection in Argentina at a level higher than expected. Between August 22 and September 9, the spread between the Over-Selic rate and the Futures DI to January reduced to 190 bp from 340 bp. Nonetheless, after the attacks to the U.S. on September 11, this trajectory reverted, with the spread increasing to 320 bp on September 17. On that date, a higher slope was observed in the whole extension of the curve. 
In September, the strategy of rolling over integrally the principal and final interest payments of exchange rate indexed securities, preferably with placements of NTN-D, has started. As a means to roll over the R$5.8 billion in NBCE redeeming on September 6, three auctions of 3-year NTND were carried out, at a financial volume equivalent to 67% of the total redeemed, in addition to an 11-month placement, matching the demand for long term securities. The yield for the three-year securities reduced to 10.38% p.a. in the last auction from 10.87% p.a. in the two first ones. For shorter maturity securities, the average yield was of 5.54% p.a..
The rollover of the R$3.7 billion redemption on September 17 was carried out with two auctions of three-year NTND (totaling 69% of the redemption), at rates of 11.50% and 11.95%, and an 8-month security offer at an average yield of 5.81%. On August 29, there was still a 3-year NBCE auction to rollover R$1.1 billion in NTND maturing on September 3. The average yield was of 10.29% p.a.. On September 13 and 14, a total of three placements of five-month NBCE was realized to meet the demand for hedge. The resulting financial volume transacted was of R$6.7 billion and the average yields were of 9.69%, 9.96% and 10.26%. The large quantities offered and the yields accepted sanctioned an increase of the exchange rate coupon. 
On August 29, a five-month LTN auction was settled. The financial volume transacted was of R$0.9 billion at an average yield of 22.6%, which presented reduction relatively to similar auction carried out in the previous week, under the expectation that the Selic target would not be elevated. In this scenario, on September 4, the National Treasury placed R$1.3 billion in 7-month LTN, at the average yield of 22.86%. 
On September 5, a five-year LFT auction was settled, totaling a financial volume of R$1.2 billion. Demand outstripped the offer (2.2), due to the lower volumes offered and investment funds' needs to recompose their portfolios, which led to a halt in the upward movement of average discounts over face values, reducing to 0.34% from 0.40%. 
Stemming from the effects of the terrorist attack on September 11 in the market, the National Treasury decided to cancel the LFT and LTN auctions scheduled for that day. The auction was resumed on September 18, with the sale of R$1.2 billion five-year LFT, at an average discount slightly below the previous auction (0.33%) and with a demand again superior to the offer (1.6 ratio). Considering the financial settlements between August 22 and September 18, a R$142 million expansionary monetary impact was observed in the period. The additional placements of NBCE offset the net redemption of National Treasury securities. 
Within a 19 working day period, the Central Bank intervened for ten times in the open market, aiming at administering the short-term interest rate. In all interventions, the Central Bank carried out purchases of federal securities with resale agreements, at a minimum yield of 19.06% p.a.. The average volume of the interventions reached R$5.3 billion.
The identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed in light of newly available information. The scenario considered in the simulations encompasses the following assumptions: 
1. August inflation rate, measured by the IPCA, reached 0.70%, near the expected results for the month, 
2. the forecasts for the prices of oil products was calculated based on the price structure implied by Brent crude oil futures contracts. The expectation for the average price of the barrel was raised to US$ 26.2 on the third quarter and to US$ 28.1 on the fourth quarter of 2001. For 2002, it was assumed that the prices of oil by-products in the domestic market would be adjusted based on the structure of costs determined by the average prices effective on the last quarter of 2001. From the second quarter on, these prices wouldfollow market inflation. 
3. for a wider set of administered prices, weighting 30.4% of the IPCA in August, the expected inflation in 2001 remained relatively stable at 11.0%, from 10.0% in August. Price variation from January to August accumulates 7.9% with further 3.0% being expected for the remainder of the year. The evolution of these prices is expected to directly contribute with 3.2% for the year inflation, compared to the 2.9% estimated in August. 
4. the forecast for the adjustment of electricity tariffs in 2001 remained at 20%. For 2002, the expected readjustment is of 20%, considering residential and non-residential consumers, 
5. the slope of the domestic yield curve - defined as the difference between the 180 day swap rate and the one day Selic rate - is projected at an average of nearly 500 basis points on the third quarter of 2001, linearly declining to an average of 300 basis points at the end of 2002, 
6. the path for the Fed funds interest rates was projected based on the maturity of forward contracts that indicate a decrease in the rate until the end of the second quarter of 2002 and a slight increase in the remainder of the year, 
7. on the external front, the ssumption for the average risk premium – measured as the difference between the yield of Brazil's Global Bonds and the United States Treasury Bonds with equivalent duration calculated by linear interpolation – was revised to incorporate a declining path from current levels to a plateau near 700 basis points from the second quarter of 2002 on. 
It was assumed a stable exchange rate, in 2001 and 2002, around the levels observed on the eve of the Copom meeting. 
The core inflation of the IPCA, calculated under the symmetric trimmed-mean method, declined in August to 0.56%, from 0.65% in July. Accumulated in 12 months, the core index increased by 6.25%. The core inflation of the IPC-BR, calculated under the symmetric trimmed-mean method, declined to 0.59% in August. Accumulated in 12 months, this core increased by 3.73%. The inflation core calculated with the exclusion of administered prices – considering the wide set weighting 30.4% of the IPCA in August - and of household food prices increased by 0.40% in August, with accumulated variation of 4.04% in 12 months. 
The median of market expectations for the IPCA variation, as surveyed by the Central Bank on a daily basis, was revised to 6.5% from 6.3% for 2001 and remained stable at 4.5% for 2002. 
In relation to the fiscal policy, it was assumed that the primary surplus targets for the consolidated public sector would be met, as stated in the Economic Program of the Government. 
The remaining assumptions established in the previous meeting were maintained. 
Simulation exercises with several specifications of the structural model allowed for the conclusion that the maintenance of the interest rate at the current level of 19.0% p.a. would result in inflation above the upper limit of the target for 2001. For 2002, the projected inflation is slightly above the 3.5% central target for the year. 
Recently released indicators confirm the slowdown trend in demand as a result of the set of shocks that affected the Brazilian economy. The drop in demand may be explained by the worsening in the external scenario, by effects of the energy crisis on expectations and by the recent tightening in monetary policy, yet enough for GDP to grow moderately this year. As addressed in the last Copom meeting, the balance between aggregate supply and demand has been exerting downward pressure on inflation, since the slowdown in demand has outstripped the effect of the energy rationing on the aggregate supply. After an expected increase in inflation in July and August , basically due to the hike in administered prices, the IPCA and other indices already show marginal decrease, with reduced variation in market prices. 
Notwithstanding the downward pressure on inflation stemming from the activity slowdown, the exchange rate remains under pressure. In the international scenario, adverse expectations prevail. The recovery of the U.S. economy had been postponed as indicated by recent released data. With the recent attacks on September 11th, the probability that this recovery will be delayed for the third quarter of next year is higher. In Europe, following the developments in the U.S. economy, the reduction trend in the pace of economic activity will be accentuated. The Japanese economy will not present signals of recovery in the short run. 
It is still premature to predict the effects of U.S. crisis in the world economy and in Brazil. Nonetheless, it is possible that the recent international scenario has two consequences in the short run: i) doubts about the world economic situation, aggravated by the attacks to the U.S., may weaken consumers’ confidence, increase the volatility in stock markets and oil prices, and reduce capital flows, and ii) the level of global economic activity shall retract, global trade flows. 
The improvement in the result of the trade balance, as a result of weaker aggregate domestic demand and depreciation of the real, and the recovery of economic growth on the second half of next year will intensify the ongoing narrowing of current account deficit and improve the quality of its financing. In the meantime, the new agreement between the IMF and Brazil will provide support for the financing of the Balance of Payments. 
The IPCA core inflation registered the second consecutive monthly reduction. Nonetheless, August outcome remains high (+0.56%). Inflation expectations, as surveyed daily by the Central Bank with the participation of a number of institutions, exhibited small marginal increase for 2001 and indicate a downward trend for inflation in 2002. In 2001, the IPCA accumulated a 5.06% variation until August, led by the evolution of administered prices (7.86%), with a contribution of 2.30% for the IPCA. The remaining prices, weighting 69.6% of IPCA, increased by 3.86% in the period, with a contribution of 2.76%. 
For 2002, the forecasts derived from Central Bank’s structural model, built upon the assumption of a constant interest rate trajectory, indicate an inflation rate above 3.5%. The increase in the projected inflation for the next year results exclusively from the path of exchange rate and energy and oil products prices . In this sense, the shocks that affected the Brazilian economy this year will still have reflexes on next year inflation. The forecast for market price inflation, upon which monetary policy has the major impact, remains significantly below 3.5%. 
Copom recognizes that there are risks of a passthrough of the recent exchange rate devaluation on domestic prices next year, as long as the exchange rate remains under pressure. However, Copom understands that the monetary policy is currently adequate to maintain market prices under control and to neutralize secondary effects of the supply shocks.
"
30/10/2001;64;Arminio Fraga;"Economic activity has leveled off at a lower pace in August and September, after having slowed since April. Indicators of consumption recovered slightly in August and September, after falling steeply in the previous quarter. Consumers, however, have remained cautious in the face of tighter credit conditions, decline in real earnings and worsening of external environment. Industrial production is slowing gradually, still sustained by placement of orders, particularly those related to deal with the energy crisis. 
The Index of Consumer Intentions (IIC), surveyed by the São Paulo State’s Federation of Commerce (FCESP), continued to fall in October, particularly affected by the turbulent environment prevailing after the events of September 11th in the United States. The surveyed sample also evidenced increasing concern on unemployment. The fall in the index by 9% affected its two components – current and future intentions – halting the rebound observed since June when the index reached its minimum by the time the energy rationing began. 
Retailers turnover expanded by 0.8% in September from August, according to FCESP. This result reflected mainly the sales of non-durable consumer goods. Nonetheless, retailers turnover dropped by 4% year to date, reflecting particularly a reduction of 19.4% in car sales. 
A more dynamic sales of non-durable goods is shown by an increase of 2.7% in September in the enquiries to the Telecheque, a leading indicator for cash and predated check payment sales, surveyed by the São Paulo Association of Commerce (ACSP), while enquiries to the Credit Protection Service (SPC), a leading indicator for credit sales, declined by 2.8%. Default rate in commerce, as measured by ACSP, remained stable at 6% in September, with both the number of new registries and cancellations falling. In the financial sector, the ratio of checks returned due to insufficient funds remained stable at 5% as compared to the previous months, though 30% higher than the level observed in 2000. 
Investment spending has evolved favorably throughout the year. According to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), the share of investments in the GDP in the first half of 2001 reached 24.7% compared to 23% in the same period of 2000. Monthly indicators of gross capital formation continue to perform positively in recent months, partly reflecting the effects of investment decisions to face the energy crisis. Output of capital goods grew by 17% in the year-to-August, with an expansion of 6.1% in August (seasonally adjusted). Equipment for electricity generation showed expansion of 46.5% and 15.5%, respectively. It should be underscored the performance of production of agricultural machinery, with expansion of 26.1% in the year and 16.6% in September. Imports of capital goods showed a similar trend, growing by 24% in the year and 5.8% in August (seasonally adjusted). Construction industry, the main component of gross capital formation, however, performed differently, contracting by 1% in August and showing stability in the year (0.4%). 
After 5 months of decline, industrial production stabilized in August (+0.2%, seasonally adjusted), mainly driven by growth in the production of capital goods, and at a lesser extent by production of semi-durable and non-durable consumer goods. It should be noted that industrial production showed stability in August compared to August 2000, evidencing that this sector overcame the restrictions in energy supply through the rationalization of consumption, substitution of energy sources, and trading of excess energy among industrial sectors. 
Despite these favorable results, some industrial sectors are being affected more intensely by the difficulties of the current economic conditions, as is the case of the production of durable goods, which declined by 7.1% in August compared to July, and 14.5% compared to August 2000. Year-to-date, it grew by 5.2%, but at a sharp slowing pace. Among the durable goods, it should be noted especially the performance of car industry. Even after the reduction in the production, inventory is still increasing, as a result of plummeting car sales in recent months. In September, the production of cars fell by 5% (seasonally adjusted), sales to car dealers dropped by 6.2%, and the inventory of vehicles in the stores was approximately 100,000 units (or around 28 days of sales). Inventory in the factories is also high, which may lead to a cut down in production, as attested by recent decisions of collective holidays determined by several carmakers. 
In August, despite positive evolution of industrial production, capacity utilization declined as compared to July. In the seasonally adjusted series, capacity utilization in the industrial sector in São Paulo fell by 0.32% and 0.4%, according to CNI and FIESP, respectively. Industrial employment and real wage also fell in August. 
Open unemployment, as computed by IBGE in six metropolitans regions, was 6.18% in August, after recording 6.19% in the previous month. The number of employed increased by 0.44% (or 75,000 jobs), though not sufficient to absorb growth of 0.42% in the employable population (PEA), resulting in an increase of 0.16% in the number of unemployed. This information, and the fact that the upward trend in formal employment remained rising by 0.1% in August (seasonally adjusted), indicated that the impact of the energy crisis on the labor market was less intense than previously projected. 
In September, in terms of daily average, new lending provided by the domestic financial system from its free resources presented an expansion in general compared to August. Even though this expansion could indicate the addition of new borrowers, it resulted in part from the concentration of demand in fewer working days (19 in September compared to 23 in August), as the accumulated flows in September reduced for almost all credit lines. 
Daily average of new credit to households in September expanded by 9.6% and accumulated flows fell by 6.2%, while in terms of volume increased by 2%. The primary contraction in the month is consistent with slowing economic activity, the level of interest rates, and uncertainties in the external environment. 
As to the external sector of the Brazilian economy, the trade balance recorded a surplus of US$ 594 million in September, and a surplus of US$ 29 million for the first two weeks in October, accumulating a surplus of US$ 1.3 billion in the year. This recent improvement in the overall trade balance is associated with the slowing in domestic economic activity and the exchange rate depreciation, leading to import reduction and maintenance of the export growth, even though at a moderate pace. The expansion in commodity sales remains notable, mainly meat and soy, as a consequence of an enlarged market opportunity resulting from livestock diseases in Europe. On the other hand, the sales of manufactured goods are decelerating, as a result of weaker demand in the major export markets (the United States and Argentina). 
In concluding, economic activity remains at a low level, due to the slowing process started by the end of the first quarter of the year. Recent outcome which might indicate a possible reversal of this trend, as shown particularly by the consumption indices, is still incipient, and has not yet incorporated fully the effects of the international crisis. Therefore, one cannot draw any conclusion as to the start of a new trend. In addition, in shaping the expectations for coming months, the decision of carmakers to reduce their output should be incorporated, as well as the impact of such a decision on the other sectors of industry. 
A slowing demand due to the lower credit expansion, and to the drop in consumers confidence, have more than offset the effect of the energy crisis on the aggregate supply, generating an output gap which contains inflationary pressures and improves the trade balance mainly by means of reduction in imports in view of difficulties in the international environment to expand exports. 
Data released last month showed that the U.S. economy has been in a slowing trend since the second half of 2000, even before the attacks of September 11th. In this regard, capital spending remained declining, with a reduction in the output of capital goods and stability in orders to factories. Data on the evolution of consumption suggest that the consumption was slowing, with retail sales declining by 2.1% in September compared to the previous month (seasonally adjusted), and a reduction of accumulated growth in 12 months to 1.8% from 3% up to August. In this context, consumer credit, which increased by US$ 2.3 billion in September, remains in a downward trend in terms of 12 month growth rate. 
The events of September 11th in the United States and the following actions have contributed considerably to the increase of uncertainties in the economic environment. In this context, and taking into account the absence of inflationary pressures, monetary and fiscal policies were loosened. After 50 points cut in the fed funds rate in an unscheduled meeting on September 17th, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates further by another 50 basis points in the regular meeting of October 2nd, after which the basic interest rate stood at 2.5%. Simultaneously, the government decided to grant a financial support of US$ 15 billion to airlines, to be disbursed in 2001 through 2002, and was also authorized by Congress to spend US$ 40 billion for assistance and recovery, which should be used during this year and the next. This financial support, added to the tax refund proposal, may represent a considerable fiscal incentive. 
Expectations that government measures to support recovery in the economic activity will be effective in the medium run are not yet explicit in the business outlook, as measured by the indices of the National Association of Purchase Managers. Overall index for the manufacturing sector remained below 50 in September, for the 14th consecutive month. The index relative to the services sector reached 50.2 in September, which was still regarded as insufficient to indicate a consistent reversal of trend. Consumers’ expectations as surveyed by the Conference Board have deteriorated, falling to 97.6 in September from 114 in August. Consumers' sentiment, as evaluated by the University of Michigan, suggested an improvement as the preliminary figure for the index rose to 83.4 in October from 81.8 in September. 
It should be pointed out that the military reaction to the attacks and fears for further offensive actions in the U.S. territory have increased the uncertainties regarding the recovery in economic activity, contributing to an even weaker performance than it would be expected for the short run in this stage of economic cycle. 
In the euro area, indicators showed that the slowing economic activity has persisted in the period. Retail sales recorded an expansion of 1.3% in July, compared to 1.5% in the previous month. Industrial production, after expanding by 1.8% in June relative to the same month last year, contracted by 1.1% in July, unemployment remained stable at a rate of 8.3% in July and August. Regarding inflation, the harmonized consumer price index has indicated a downward trend since May, when it reached 3.4% (2.7% in August, still above the reference rate of 2%). Considering the producers price index, the downward trend is even more apparent, reducing to 1.7% in August from 4.8% in January. The recent increase in the annualized quarterly moving average of the M3-- a leading indicator of inflation and first pillar of the monetary policy conducted by the European Central Bank-- is being interpreted as a transitory phenomenon and resulting from statistical problems in the measurement of the indicator, thus not regarded as a deterioration in inflation prospects. Entrepreneurs' expectations about the economic outlook of the major countries in the region remain low. In this scenario, the European Central Bank cut the basis rate by 25 points on August 30th and, in September, decided on another reduction of 50 points, to 3.75%, jointly with the Federal Reserve. 
The evolution of the Japanese economy has not been favored by the international scenario, leading the Bank of Japan to intervene in the foreign exchange market in an attempt to hold the Japanese currency against the dollar, as well as to increase the liquidity in the domestic market to stimulate the economy. 
In Argentina, uncertainties regarding the ability of its economy to recover remain, together with the maintenance of a downward trend in demand and supply. In this context, the trade balance registered a surplus of US$ 692 million in August, accumulating a surplus of US$ 3 billion in the year. This performance reflects mainly a contraction of 7.8% in imports, while exports increased by 4%. The widening of spread of Argentine securities has affected other emerging market papers, as perceived by international investors. 
In summary, the process of slowing in the U.S. economy, which had already affected other industrial countries, with negative impact on the emerging economies, mostly for those within its area of influence, tends to be exacerbated by the consequences of the September attacks, delaying therefore the start of economic recovery. 
In September, inflation measured by the main price indices abated, reflecting the reduction in agricultural prices and, especially, the easing of pressures derived from adjustment of administered prices which weighed considerably on these indices in the two previous months. 
The IPCA rose by 0.28% in September, compared to 0.70% in August, accumulating 6.46% in 12 months. This result was due to a smaller increment in the administered prices and to a fall in agricultural prices, particularly fresh products. Food prices decelerated to 0.39% in September from 0.83% in August. Still, higher cost pressures on food prices persisted, coming from off-season effects and/or climate problems, and effects from the exchange rate depreciation. Prices of non-food products eased to 0.25% in September, compared to 0.66% in August in view of the ending of the period where controlled price adjustments are concentrated. Nevertheless, this sector contributed to 0.19 percentage point in the IPCA variation, affected by the rise in urban bus fares in Recife and Salvador, intermunicipal bus fares in five of the eleven capitals surveyed for the price collection, water and sewage in Rio de Janeiro and electricity prices in Belém, Brasilia and Goiânia. 
The IGP-DI recorded a deceleration to 0.38% in September, from 0.9% in August, accumulating 7.81% in 2001 and 9.44% in the 12 month period. Compared to the previous month, the deceleration was observed in all components, led by the IPA, which declined to 0.48%, from 1.13%. This result was associated with the negative variation in the agricultural IPA in September (minus 0.21%) from 1.33% in August driven by the reductions in the prices of milk and eggs, affecting also their retail prices as food prices in the CPI decreased by 0.37%. Upward pressures from exchange rate, however, persisted on the prices of soy and its by-product, in addition to supply problems due to off-season effects in some products such as rice, beans and cattle. The monthly variation of the Industrial IPA slowed to 0.75% in September, from 1.05% in August, with the main determining factors being the price behavior of processed food products and chemicals. The INCC rose by 0.55% simply as a result, for the third consecutive month, of increases in civil construction prices and services (1.07% from 1.22% in August), while labor costs remained stable. 
A larger increase in all indices is expected for October, basically as a consequence of the fuel price adjustment on October 5th. It should be pointed out also the pressures on agricultural products, especially regarding those still affected by off-season factors. Nonetheless, these pressures are localized, and there are no expectations of a generalized price increase, taking into account the weak demand and the absence of indexation mechanisms in the economy. 
The volatility in the interest rate yield curve increased since the last Copom meeting, due to the effects of the attacks in the USA and increased uncertainties in Argentina. The slope of the interest rate yield curve, as measured by the spread between the Over Selic rate and the 90 day Futures DI rate widened by 255 basis points to 370, between September 19th to October 9th. Nonetheless, after the parliamentary elections in Argentina, the slope reverted partially and the spread narrowed to 300 basis points on October 15th. 
Between September 11th and October 11th, 21 unscheduled offers of exchange rate indexed securities were carried out by the central bank, amounting to R$23.4 billion in financial volumes. Since end-September, the unscheduled placements have been carried out with NTN-D. On October 3rd and 4th, the National Treasury attempted to lengthen the tenure of the outstanding securities by offering maturities to 2003 and 2004. Low demand and increased bid yields, however, were observed, leading to further placements of NTN-D with maturity in 2002. 
In addition, four auctions of federal securities were carried out between September 19th and October 16th to roll over maturing exchange rate indexed securities. As a means to roll over the R$1.2 billion maturing on September 25th, two auctions were carried out. In the first, R$0.2 billion was placed through 3-year NTN-D. In spite of the shortened maturity, demand was below supply. The rollover of the R$4.1 billion in NBC-E on October 18th was made through two placements of NTN-D. The first offer, of 5-year securities, was placed only partially, due to the high bid yields. The second, with a shorter maturity, was fully sold. The longer maturity issues represented only 7% of the total maturing value. 
On October 2nd, the National Treasury proceeded with the offers of LTN, which had been interrupted as a result of the effects of the attacks in the US on the market. Until October 16th, three auctions of 6-month papers were carried out, totaling R$3.1 billion. Average yields have been reduced from 24.28%, to 24.19%, and then to 23.71%. Demand/offer ratios were higher (2.5, 3.4, and 2.0), as the future DI yield curve presented a significant premium over the Selic rate. 
On September 25th, an auction of five-year LFT was carried out, totaling a financial volume of R$0.6 billion, at an average discount of 0.33%. In October, in spite of the shortening of maturity of the securities to 2 years from 5 years, demand was below the supply in both events in the month. In the auction of October 2nd, R$1.3 billion were placed at an average discount of 0.16%. In the following week, R$0.5 billion was placed at an average discount of 0.24%. 
Considering the financial settlements between September 19th and October 16th, a contractionary monetary impact of R$5.1 billion was observed in the period. The net placement of R$14.8 billion in exchange rate indexed securities offset the net redemptions of LTN and LFT. 
Within 19 working day period, the central bank intervened for sixteen times in the open market, aiming at administering the short-term interest rate. In all interventions, the central bank carried out purchases of federal securities with resale agreements, at minimum yields ranging from 19.05% p.a. to 19.10% p.a.. The average volume of the interventions reached R$14.2 billion. In addition, the central bank carried out two go-arounds to purchase LFT to reduce the liquidity shortage in the system. In the first operation, on October 2nd, no bids were accepted. In the second, however, on October 5th, R$4.3 billion were purchased at the average discount of 0.06%. 
Identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed in light of newly available information. The scenario considered in the simulations encompasses the following hypotheses: 
1. September’s inflation rate, measured by IPCA, recorded 0.28%, which was lower than expected, 
2. the projection for prices of oil by-products was computed based on the term structure of prices implied in the Brent crude oil futures contracts. The expectation for the average price of the barrel of the Dated Brent was substantially reduced to US$20.4 in the fourth quarter of 2001. For 2002, it was assumed that the prices of oil by-products prices in the domestic market will show an important reduction as compared to the assumption of substantial rise made in the last Copom meeting, 
3. for a wider set of administered prices, the expected adjustment in 2001 reduced to 10.0% in October from 11.0% in September, 
4. the projection for the adjustment of electricity prices in 2001 and 2002 remained at approximately 20% p.a., 
5. the slope of the domestic yield curve - measured as a difference between the 180-day term DI rate and the 1-day Selic rate - is projected at an average of 450 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2001, declining linearly to an average of 300 basis points in the last quarter of 2002, 
6. the path for the fed funds rate was projected based on the maturity of futures contracts, which indicates a reduction in the rate to 2.5% through the end of the first quarter of 2002 with stability thereafter, 
7. on the external front, the assumption for the average risk premium was revised to incorporate a declining path from current levels to a plateau near 700 basis points from the second quarter of 2002 on. 
GDP growth in the second quarter of 2001 was modified to reflect the revision made by the IBGE, to 1.82% from 0.79% compared to the same period of previous year. 
The core inflation of the IPCA, calculated under the symmetric trimmed-mean method, remained stable at 0.57% in September. Accumulated in 12 months, the core index increased by 6.41%. The core inflation of the IPC-BR, calculated under the symmetric trimmed-mean method, declined to 0.50% in September. Accumulated in 12 months, this core increased by 6.05%. The inflation core calculated with the exclusion of administered prices – considering the wide set weighing 30.6% of the IPCA in September - and of household food prices increased by 0.25% in August, with accumulated variation of 4.04% in 12 months. 
The median of market expectations for the IPCA inflation, as surveyed by the central bank in a daily basis, was revised upwards to 6.60%, from 6.50% for 2001 and to 5.00% from 4.50% for 2002. 
Year-to-date, the IPCA increased by 5.35% in September, of which 2.4% referred to administered prices (8.3% variation) and 2.9% to free prices (4.1% variation). For the remaining of the year, it is expected a 0.5% contribution from administered prices (for 1.6% variation). The evolution of the administered prices is expected to contribute directly to 2.9% for the year inflation, compared to the 3.2% estimated in September. 
In relation to the fiscal policy, it was assumed that the primary surplus targets for the consolidated public sector will be met, as stated in the Economic Program of the Government. 
The other assumptions made in the previous meeting were maintained. 
Simulation exercises with several specifications of the structural model led to a conclusion that the maintenance of the interest rate at the current level of 19.0% p.a. would result in inflation above the upper limit of the target for 2001. For 2002, the projected inflation will be near the 3.5% central target for the year. 
Industrial production in August shows signs of accommodation of the economic activity at a level lower than the one registered at the beginning of the year, as a result of the decelerating trend starting in the first quarter. This deceleration has implied an asymmetric decrease in the use of factors of production. On the one hand, capacity utilization in the industry has been lower in various regions of the country, falling for the fifth consecutive month. On the other hand, employment indicators have indicated stability in the number of job opening in August, after a period of increases from March to May this year. Likewise, seasonally adjusted open unemployment rate presented a slight reduction in August. 
A more accentuated reduction in capacity utilization may be reflecting the lagged reaction of employment to the pace of economic activity and the effect of the energy crisis. Alternatively, the stability in the employment may indicate that the slowing economy is perceived as temporary. This possibility is reinforced by consumption indicators, which signaled a slight recovery in August and September, after strong reduction in the previous quarter, what could point to a possible reversal in the trend. 
However, these consumption indicators are incipient, not incorporating fully the impact of the international turmoil, mainly after September incidents. Consumers remain cautious, as indicated by the Index of Consumer's Intention in October, in the face of tighter credit conditions, reduced real income and deteriorated external scenario. Industrial production has been sustained by placement of orders, particularly those dealing with the energy crisis. In addition, as the prospects for the coming months are drawn, the decision of the carmakers in reducing their production should be considered, as well as the impact on the other sectors of industry. Therefore, under the effects of several shocks on the economy, and particularly the recent events in the United States, it is premature to conclude on the recovery in the level of activity. 
Uncertainties on the external scenario increased recently. In the industrial countries, as a response to the incidents of September 11th in the United States, a slowdown in the consumption is observed, notwithstanding the drastic cut in interest rates made by the major central banks. Financial assets’ markets remain volatile, after sharp falls observed in the weeks that followed the September events. Capital flows responded negatively to the events and a decrease in the flows of international trade is projected as a result of a lower level of activity in the world economy. In Argentina, the difficulties remain. The sovereign risk premium reached a level as high as 1,800 basis-points in the weeks before the elections of October 14th. In Brazil, deterioration in the external scenario and concerns on capital flows put pressure on exchange rate. On positive side, oil prices may respond to the slower growth in demand, by remaining at levels significantly lower than those observed this year. 
Inflation expectations for 2002, measured by the medians of the responses surveyed by the central bank, were raised recently and reached a plateau considerably higher than those of Copom. Since these expectations may be interpreted as indicators of the actual projections made by price and wage setters in the Brazilian economy, the recent rise might indicate future pressure on prices. In fact, entrepeneurs’ expectations indicated in polls seem to reflect more intensely the current difficulty in passing through cost increases to prices. 
In comparing analysts' expectations and the Copom’s projections, three relevant factors should be considered. First, inflation expectation in the survey tends to consider an additional depreciation in the exchange rate in 2002. Copom considers exchange rate level in the day before its meeting as a methodological reference to the period of projection. There is the risk that additional depreciation may cause a passthrough to prices and an increase in the projected inflation for this year and the next. In the relevant horizon, some factors may contribute more directly to stabilize exchange rates. For instance, recent measures taken to reduce liquidity in the financial system and a lower demand for hedging from companies seeking protection for their liabilities’ exposure to exchange rate risk. In this sense, lower volatility in the exchange rate tends to minimize such a defensive behavior. Moreover, improvements in trade balance and current account may indicate increasingly a trend towards a larger and permanent supply of resources in foreign currency over the medium-term, and increased confidence in the Brazilian economy for a sustainable growth in the coming years. 
Second, analysts’ projections consider a higher passthrough of the recent or year-to-date accumulated depreciation to prices next year. Copom considers that the risk of the depreciation being passed through to prices depends on demand levels (see empirical evidences on the Inflation Report – September 2001). Therefore, in the Copom’s evaluation, slowing demand due to lower credit expansion and to lower consumers confidence has more than offset energy crisis effect on aggregate supply. This has produced an output gap whose effect may contain inflation pressures. Moreover, Copom uses Selic rate constant over its projection period as a methodological reference while the median of the analysts’ projections considers a gradual reduction of this rate. 
And finally, some analysts believe that higher inflation in 2001 shall put pressure on inflation next year. It is important to observe, however, that the increase in inflation this year is due primarily to a combination of adverse shocks which would not necessarily persist over the coming months. There are solid evidence of a smaller inflation inertia in the Brazilian economy in recent years. The projected fall in inflation for the fourth quarter this year, after a higher level in the third quarter, reinforces this assumption. 
Copom remains alert to higher risk of an additional passthrough to prices and/or more than expected levels of inflation inertia in Brazil. Copom understands, however, that monetary policy is adequate to meet the inflation target for the next year. This conclusion contemplates external uncertainties, demand stability in a level lower than expected early this year, associated to a still unclear prospects for economic recovery, which may limit the possibility of passthrough of exchange rates to the inflation.
"
03/12/2001;65;Arminio Fraga;"The most recent released data indicate that the economic activity has stabilized between the third and fourth quarters of the year, interrupting the declining trend in place since April. The economic stability reveals that the adjustment of demand to the several shocks that occurred this year may be over, as indicated by the behavior of retail sales and consumer intentions. 
Short term expectations of consumers improved. The Consumer Intentions Index (IIC), surveyed by the Federation of Commerce of the State of São Paulo(FCESP), increased by 0.2% in November compared to the previous month. The component that measures current consumption intentions rose by 7%, revealing that customers have overcome the negative emotional impacts caused by recent international events. Nonetheless, the survey also revealed that consumers remain cautious in regard to the future economic environment, fearing an increase in unemployment and inflation, important reasons explaining the 3.4% fall in future consumption intentions. 
Retail sales in October increased for the third consecutive month. Retailers turnover in the Metropolitan Region of São Paulo, measured by FCESP and seasonally adjusted by Central Bank’s Economic Department (Depec), increased by 1.2%, as a result of the recovery of car and light vehicle sales through dealers chains to final consumers, basically due to special financing . As the other segments surveyed presented lower sales in comparison to September, the overall retailers’ turnover was lower than in the same period last year. 
The National Confederation of Industries (CNI) registered a 3.79% expansion of real industrial sales in September (seasonally adjusted series), which led to a 14.5% growth year to date. Seasonally adjusted industrial sales moved back by 0.3% in September, reflecting the negative performance of twelve out of the twenty industrial sectors, and three out of four categories of use, the exception being the production of semi-durable and non-durable consumer goods, which registered a 0.2% increase due to the performance of food producers, mainly the ones directed to external markets. In the year, industrial production accumulates a 3.1% expansion. 
The utilization rate of industrial capacity reached 79.15% in September showing a reduction for the seventh consecutive month in September (0.57%), as informed by CNI (data seasonally adjusted by Depec). Nonetheless, year to date results are still 0.29% above the levels of the same period last year. 
The open unemployment rate, calculated by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) for six Metropolitan Regions, was of 6.15% in September, compared to 6.18% in August. The average rate for the first three quarters of the year reached 6.24%, contrasting with the 7.54% in the same period of 2000. It should be noted the 0.2% expansion in the seasonally adjusted series of formal employment, leading to a 3% increase year to date, corresponding to 772.7 thousand new labor positions up to September. 
Investment indicators still show a favorable performance, despite the 4.9% and 11.3% decline observed in September in the production and imports of capital goods, respectively. Domestic production of such goods, specifically intended to face the energy crisis, grew by 46.4% ytd, compared to a 15.2% expansion of the overall production of capital goods. It is also worth emphasizing the 18.2% increase in the production of agricultural machinery, partly due to exports. Production of inputs for the civil construction industry also declined in September (2.3% in the seasonally adjusted series), leading to a 0.4% fall ytd. Based on the performance of investment indices, gross capital formation reached 21.5% of the GDP in September, as estimated by Depec.
Exports of the soybean and by products grew by 25.7% from January to October, in comparison to the same period of 2000. It should be highlighted that this result was due to the increase of the shipped quantum, since average prices fell on the same comparison basis. Besides the performance of soybean and by products, exports of meat were also strong thanks to the qualification of Brazilian products that conquered new markets that had been left unserviced due to the diseases in European cattle herds. The 23.7% and 2.4% increase in the sales of basic products and manufactured goods, respectively, created the 7.3% daily average increase in overall exports in the aforementioned period. 
Considering just ten working-days up to the third week of November, the trade balance totaled US$ 213 million, increasing the year to date accumulated surplus to US$1.7 billion. This improvement in the trade surplus is a result of reduced imports, as a consequence of both the depreciation of the Real and the deceleration of domestic activity. Furthermore exports of manufactured goods are expanding at a slower pace, given the constraints in foreign markets. 
The outstanding balance of the financial system credit operations increased by 0.8% in October, reaching R$ 335.4 billion, of which R$199.1 billion refer to operations with freely allocated resources, which increased by 0.6%. Such growth was caused by the 0.2% reduction in operations with corporations, where the outstanding balance of Anticipated Exchange Contracts (ACC) plummeted, while credit to households increased by 2.2%. 
As for new loans, a 14.4% increase was registered in operations with corporations in October. The outcome reflected more working-days in October in relation to September, and also seasonal patterns of the period, particularly operations with working capital (capital de giro) and authorized overdraft (conta garantida). In relation to household credits, their overall balance increased by 14.1%, to a great extent due to the performance of credit card operations. 
The collection of taxes and contributions administered by the Federal Revenue Secretariat totaled R$17.1 billion in October, an increase of 17.3% in the month and 14.7% ytd compared to the same period last year. These increases were mainly due to the growth of the collection of Income Tax Withholdings (IRRF), especially on capital gains, to the Provisional Contribution on Financial Transactions (CPMF), to the Income Tax (IR) and to the Social Contribution on Net Income (CSLL) of financial entities, influenced by their enlarged profits. It should be mentioned that taxes that are more directly related to the level of economic activity performed below the overall average collection, reflecting the deceleration of economic activity. 
In summary, there are indicators showing that economic activity has already absorbed the impacts caused by the deterioration of the external environment and the energy crisis, what points to a gradual recovery in growth. This interpretation is also supported by the favorable performance of formal employment, enhanced by positive expectations related to year-end sales, previously postponed by the uncertainties affecting decisions of consumers and producers. 
Economic indicators in industrialized countries show that the deceleration of the economic activity, in place since the beginning of this year, has been replaced by a contraction, beginning at the end of the third quarter. In the United States, GDP declined by 0.4% this quarter, compared with the previous quarter (seasonally adjusted and annualized data). In the Euro area, national and regional indicators available point to a significant reduction in the growth rate for the third quarter. Japan’s GDP declined in the second quarter, leading the Bank of Japan to reduce its growth projections for the current fiscal year. 
In the United States, GDP in the third quarter contracted for the first time since 1993 (0.4%), reflecting the impacts of economic weakening made worse by the terrorist attacks of September 11th. The result was affected by the private investment behavior, -10.7%, which has declined by over 10% for the past three quarters. Consumer consumption, which had been supporting output, grew by 1.2%, after reaching 2.5% in the previous quarter. The 1.1% reduction in industrial production in October, the 13th consecutive contraction, reducing the variation in the 12-month accumulated figures to -1.4% from -0.5% in the previous month. The unemployment rate increased half of a percentage point, reaching 5.4% in October, when there were 415,000 less job offers in the non-agriculture sector. 
Demand indicators are still showing decline. Personal expenditures with consumption declined by 1.3% in September, and increased by 3.4% in the last 12 months, maintaining the downward trend. Orders to the factories and production of capital goods were negative in 5.8% and 2.3% respectively in September, with the accumulated variation over 12 months registering -5.7% and 1.8%. Retail sales increased by 7.7% in October, after having declined by 2.2% in the previous month, a result coming mainly from the 25.9% increase in the automobile sales. The core index, which excludes vehicles and autoparts and components increased by 1%, in line with market expectations. Credit to consumers increased by 0.2% in September, and the accumulated in 12 months declined to 6.8% from 7.4%, between August and September. Finally, although the initial construction of residential homes indicator presented a contraction of 1.3% in October, the accumulated result over 12 months was positive for the first time since February 2000, reaching 0.4%. Mirroring the slowdown in the economic activity and the new government policy, plus the initial impacts of the fiscal measures adopted after September 11th, the federal government fiscal result was lower than in the previous year from June on, reverting the trend of increasing surpluses observed since 1998. The fiscal year of 2001 represented a $127.2 billion surplus, 46.3% below the record result of $236.7 billion in 2000. 
The terrorist attacks hit market expectations, captured by surveys with entrepreneurs (NAPM) and consumers (Conference Board). Expectation indicators in the manufacturing sector, as measured by NAPM, declined to 39.8 in October from 47 in September, once more indicating economic contraction. In the services sector the reduction measured by NAPM in the same period was from 50.2 to 40.6. Consumer confidence was also affected, and the index declined by 28.5 points between August and October reaching 85.5. 
With the slowdown in the economic activity and the reduction in the energy prices, especially petroleum, inflation indices declined, widening the space for a more expansionist monetary policy. Consumer prices (IPC) declined by 0.3% in October, with an annual growth of 2.6% in September and 2.1% in October. The IPC core in October increased by 0.2% in the month, and 2.6% ytd. Producer Prices (IPP) declined the most, -1.6% in October, with a negative variation of 0.4% ytd. 
Several U.S. statistics indicate a scenario which lacks dynamism, with the likely repetition of the negative GDP result in the two following quarters. Recovery should start from the second quarter of 2002 on with the full effects of the fiscal and monetary policy measures. 
In the Euro area, world economic slowdown negatively affected the activity level. Notwithstanding, retail sales and trade balance results increased in August. In regard to the first, annual growth increased to 1.8% from 1.5%, while trade balance surplus reached $18.7 billion accumulated in the last 12 months until August, $5.6 billion above the result in the previous month. In September, industrial production registered the third negative variation in the year, 0.6%, while the unemployment rate remained stable at 8.3% in September. Harmonized Consumer Price Index (IPCH) declined to 2.4% ytd in October from 3.4% in May. The quarterly moving average of the M3, first pillar of the monetary policy in the region, however, accelerated from March on and reached a 6.9% growth in August, above the 4.5% reference. In the main countries of the Euro area, business expectations remain unfavorable, with emphasis on the 12 percentage points reduction in the Italian indicator, between August and September. 
In Japan, the contraction of the main indicators of domestic demand – factory orders, residential home construction initiations and spending-, together with the cooling down of the external demand, the deflation, and the lack of supply reaction to the zero interest rate monetary policy, form a scenario of continued recession. The Bank of Japan revised its expectations of GDP growth for the fiscal year to a range of –0.6% and –1.6% from a range of 0.3% to 0.8%. 
In Argentina, continued recession makes it more difficult to reach the “zero deficit” target between October and December, mainly due to the reduction in tax collection. The government initiated a debt swap program with local creditors, aiming at reducing interest rate burden. This program was interpreted by the rating agencies as a “selective default”, resulting in additional lowering of the country’s ratings. The difficulties in Argentina reflected in the sovereign risk indicators, with the spread of the Argentine bonds and US securities surpassing 3,000 basis points. 
In October, the inflation rate measured both by the general and the consumer price indices increased once again. This upward movement reflected mainly the readjustment of fuel prices and the increase in the prices of cigarettes, rice – due to a smaller than expected harvest -, and meat - caused by off-season problems and exchange rate effects related to export growth. 
The IPCA rose by 0.83% in October compared to 0.28% in September, accumulating 6.22% ytd and 7.19% in 12 months. Food prices increased by 1.15%, mainly due to the 10.7% and the 5.23% increase in the prices of rice and meat, respectively, responsible for 0.23 percentage points in the monthly variation of index. The prices of non-food products increased by 0.74%, with the 3.58% increase in gasoline prices being the largest individual contribution to the IPCA of the month (0.16 percentage point). The prices of cigarettes went up by 6.38%, reflecting a 14% average readjustment in place since October 12th . 
The IGP-DI increased by 1.45% in October, compared to 0.38% in September, accumulating 9.36% ytd and 10.62% in 12 months. In relation to the previous month, there was an acceleration in all of its component indices, more intensively in the IPA, which increased by 1.88% from 0.48%, responding for 1.13 percentage points of the IGP result. The growth in October wholesale prices reflected the behavior of agricultural prices, which increased by 1.74% from 0.48%, as well as industrial products, which rose by 1.94% from 0.75%. The lower supply of important agricultural products, caused by off-season problems and by smaller than expected harvests, together with the influence of the depreciated exchange rate and the readjustment of fuel prices were the main reasons which explain the hike in wholesale prices, especially beef, rice, oranges, and fuel. In the retail segment, the main influence came from food (0.27 pp), transport (0.16 pp), housing (0.13 pp) and personal expenditures (0.1 pp). 
For November, a smaller increase is expected for all indices, although the results will still be influenced by pressures posed by October readjustments, particularly of fuel and cigarettes. The prices of meat and its by-products will continue to increase due to the reduction in supply, affected by off-season problems and the increase in exports. The readjustments of electric energy in Light’s distribution area, added to urban bus fares hikes in Rio de Janeiro and prices of medicines , will also be observed in November results. 
Since the last Copom meeting, the slope of the interest rate curve showed continued reduction. The reduction in interest rates was stimulated by improvements in the prospects for the domestic economy. The more optimistic forecasts for the Balance of Payments, the exchange rate appreciation, and the expressive fiscal surplus built up the basis for a more favorable perception of the fundamentals of the domestic economy, leading to the decoupling of Brazil’s sovereign risk from Argentina’s. As a result, the spread between the Over-Selic rate and the three-month Futures DI to February declined to 13 bps on November 19th from 210 bps on October 17th . Likewise, the one-year interest rate spread decreased to 150 bp from 560 bp. 
After a massive selling of R$23.4 billion in exchange rate indexed securities placed between September 13th and October 10th , there was a sole unscheduled offer of NTN-D on October 25th , amounting to R$ 1.6 billion. The improvement in the domestic scenario led to a lower demand for hedging. In addition, there were three auctions to rollover expiring exchange rate indexed securities in November. The strategy adopted was to lengthen the issuance tenure. The resulting financial volume transacted was of R$5.5 billion, 83% of which with securities maturing between 3 and 7 years. 
The National Treasury continued to offer six-month LTN on a weekly basis, recommencing at the beginning of October. Five LTN public offers were carried out since October 23rd , totaling R$ 7.3 billion. The improved prospects for the domestic economy accentuated the demand for fixed rate securities. The average yields presented a downward trend, decreasing to 20.02% on November 20th from 23.04% on October 23rd . The demand/supply ratio in the auctions oscillated between 1.6 and 2.7. 
As a result of the financial settlements which occurred between October 17th and November 20th , a R$5.2 billion expansionist monetary impact was observed in the period. This impact resulted from the net liquidations of R$3.2 billion in LTN, R$1.2 billion in LFT and R$1.1 billion in exchange rate indexed securities. 
During a 21 working day period, the Central Bank intervened nine times in the open market, aiming at administering the very short-term interest rate. In all operations, the Central Bank provided liquidity to the market at a hurdle yield of 19.05%. The average volume of the interventions was of R$18.3 billion, at a 2.3 day average tenure. 
The identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed in the light of newly available information. The scenario considered in the simulations considering the following hypotheses: 
1. October inflation rate, measured by the IPCA, reached 0.83%, above the expected result, 
2. The forecast for prices of oil-by products was calculated based on the term structure of prices implied in the Brent crude oil futures contracts. The expectation for the trajectory of the average price of the Data Brent barrel was substantially reduced to US$19 in the last quarter of 2001, reaching US$20 at the end of 2002. This trend projects a 4.9% reduction in fuel prices to consumers in 2002, 
3. For a wider set of contractual prices, the expected readjustment in 2001 increased to 10.8% in November from 10.0% in October. For 2002, the expected readjustment is of 5.8%, 
4. The forecast for the readjustment of electricity tariffs in 2001 remained at approximately 20%. For 2002, a higher readjustment is expected, which may reach 30%, 
5. The projected slope of the domestic yield curve, measured as the difference between the 180-day term DI rate and the 1-day Selic rate, was significantly reduced to an average of 297 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2001, linearly declining to an average of 250 b.p. in the first quarter of 2002, and remaining stable until the end of the year, 
6. The path of the U.S. fed funds rate projected based on the maturity of futures contracts was altered to reflect an average rate of 2.2% in the fourth quarter of 2001, declining to 1.9% in the first quarter of 2002 and showing a moderate increase thereafter, 
7. On the external front, the assumption for the average risk premium, using Brazil’s Global 04 Bonds, incorporates a declining path from current levels to a plateau near 700 b.p. from the second quarter on, with stability thereafter, 
The core inflation of the IPCA, calculated under the symmetric trimmed-mean method, remained stable at 0.57% in October. Accumulated in 12 months, the core index increased by 6.57%. The core inflation of the IPC-BR, calculated under the symmetric trimmed mean-method, rose by 0.56% in October. Accumulated in 12 months, this core increased by 6.42%. The inflation core calculated with the exclusion of contractual prices – considering the wide set weighing 30.6% in the IPCA in October – and of household food prices increased by 0.48% in October, with accumulated variation of 4.28% in 12 months. 
Year-to-date, the IPCA increased by 6.22% in October, reflecting the 2.8% contribution from contractual prices (9.5% variation) and 3.4% from free prices (4.8% variation). For the remainder of the year, a 0.4% contribution is expected from contractual prices (1.3% variation). The evolution of the contractual prices is expected to directly contribute with 3.2% for the year inflation, compared to the 2.9% estimated in October. In 2002, the contractual prices are expected to increase by 5.8% (with a direct contribution of 1.8%, which excludes the second-round effects on inflation), influenced by the 30% hikes in electricity for the residential consumer. 
Regarding fiscal policy, it was assumed that the primary surplus targets for the consolidated public sector stated in the Government Economic Program will be achieved. The remaining assumptions made in the previous meeting were maintained. 
Simulation exercises with several specifications of the structural model led to the conclusion that the maintenance of the interest rate at the current level of 19.0% p.a. and of the exchange rate at the same plateau as of the eve of the Copom meeting would result in inflation above the upper limit of the target for 2001. For 2002, the projected inflation is around 4.0%. 
Positive expectations regarding the Brazil’s economic performance in 2001 and 2002 contributed to the appreciation of the Real as well as to the reduction in Brazil’s risk. The Real significantly appreciated since the last COPOM meeting, changing to R$ 2,50-2,55/US$ on the eve of the meeting. Brazil’s risk premium as measured by the yield’s differential between the Global 04 and the U.S. Treasury bond of equivalent duration also improved, as may be observed by the drop higher than 250 bps in the period. Therefore, the upward trend observed until mid-October reversed, which becomes more important when compared to the increased risk of emerging countries, specially that of Argentina. Particularly, the expectation of a reduction in the current account deficit and an improvement in the country’s external financing, supported by the monetary and exchange policy adjustments, contributed to the appreciation of the Real as well as to the reduction of Brazil’s risk. 
This improvement was also followed by a significant reduction in the international prices of Brent crude oil to US$ 19/barrel from US$ 22/barrel since the last meeting. Besides the direct benefit of the drop of international crude oil prices on inflation, there is still an indirect benefit caused by the lower pressure on the exchange rate market, given the weight of this item in our imports. 
The expectation regarding the economic growth also improved. There are signs of a smooth reversion of the cooling trend that followed the effects of the shocks that hit the economy, such as the deceleration of the world economy, the Argentine crisis, the September 11th attacks in the U.S. and the energy rationing, in addition to the effects of the more restrictive domestic monetary policy after March 2001. The reversion, yet incipient, can be observed in the increases in the retail commerce in São Paulo, in the number of requests to the Credit Protection Service (SPC) and in the Consumer Intentions Index, as well as in the stability observed in industrial activity. 
A reduction in the slope of the term interest rate came along with a lower exchange rate pressure and a drop in Brazil’s risk. The slope for 6 month-tenure fell to around 130 bps on the eve of the last Copom meeting from an average of 524 bps in the third quarter. 
Despite the favorable performance of the economy, there was not a correspondent improvement in the prospects for inflation. The median expectations for the IPCA variation, considering the sample comprising the aggregate of the surveyed financial institutions collected daily by the Central Bank, showed an increase to 7.1% from 6.6% for 2001 and to 5.1% from 5.0% for 2002. 
There are several factors which might have contributed to the worsening of the inflation forecasts. Firstly, the IPCA in October registered an increase higher than that expected, reflecting a higher passthrough of the exchange rate depreciation occurred during the year to prices. The increase in inflation in 2001 tends to feed the expected inflation for 2002 through its inertial component. Indeed, the indicators of the core inflation, calculated under the symmetric trimmed-mean average method, remains at a high plateau. 
Secondly, the lower slope of the term structure of the interest rate also contributes to demand recovery, what could lead to larger pressure on the prices in 2002. This effect may attenuate the downward impacts of the recent appreciation of the Real upon the inflation in 2002. 
Finally, the perspectives regarding the readjustment of the contractual prices next year remain high. Particularly, the increase in electricity prices may reach 30%. Besides, the reduction of the subsidies to the cooking gas prices is being considered, which implies in price increase. These increases mean an important supply shock for the economy in 2002. In general terms, the behavior of the contractual prices should directly contribute with 3.2% of the inflation in 2001 and, at least, with 1.8% in 2002 (even excluding the second-round effects of these increases on inflation). 
In summary, the improvement in several Brazilian economic indicators was not accompanied by an improvement in inflation forecasts despite the favorable effects of the exchange rate appreciation and the drop in international oil prices. The hikes in contractual prices expected for 2002 represent a supply shock that adds to the secondary impact of the shocks occurred this year on the prices. This imposes narrow limits to the free prices inflation indicator next year. In this context, the incipient recovery of the demand, which might be stimulated by the lower slope of the interest rate curve and by an improvement in the expectations in general, must be monitored to avoid the passthrough of the shocks of 2001 for the inflation in 2002.
"
03/01/2002;66;Arminio Fraga;"The recent behavior of the economic indicators have shown that the country’s economy is gradually overcoming the several shocks that affected it throughout the year. The level of economic activity is indicating the end of the deceleration process which has been present since April, and a trend of gradual recovery is emerging for the coming months. At the same time, the trade balance maintained its surplus, as observed throughout the year, reinforcing the adjustment of the external accounts. On the fiscal side, the results remained favorable, outperforming the targets agreed upon with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). 
Regarding retail commerce, preliminary results for November confirmed the trend of consumption recovery observed since August. Retailers real turnover increased by 1.8% in the Metropolitan Region of São Paulo, according to the data from the Federation of Commerce of the State of São Paulo (FCESP), seasonally adjusted by Central Bank’s Economic Department (Depec), reflecting bigger sales of durable and non-durable consumer goods. Year to November, the real turnover declined 4.8%. 
The recovery of the consumption continues to improve, according to recent results of surveys on consumer expectations. The Consumer Intentions Index (IIC), also surveyed by FCESP, increased for the third consecutive month in December, increasing by 3.5% in comparison to the previous month. This outcome resulted from the improvement of the two components of the index, current and future consumption intentions, reflecting the positive perception of consumers regarding the consequences of the domestic and external shocks. The National Consumer Expectations Index (INEC), issued quarterly by the National Confederation of Industries, presented similar behavior, recovering throughout the second semester by reaching 91.1 in June, 93.2 in September and 94 in November. 
In spite of the favorable scenario of the retail trade, default rates increased considerably during last month. The net default rate, measured by the Commercial Association of São Paulo (ACSP), increased to 8.4% in November from 6.2% in October. According to ACSP, the main reasons for such behavior were the increase in unemployment and the fall in the real average income. Nonetheless, the ACSP expects the rate to decline in December, returning to the 6% level, as a seasonal occurrence and, as a result of the payment of 13th salaries plus seasonal consumer behavior, consequently recovering their credit status for end-of-year purchases. The share of checks with insufficient funds in relation to the total of cleared checks increased in November to 5.2% compared to 5.1% in the previous month. Regarding credit operations of the financial system, the ratio of loans in arrears for up to ninety days in relation to the overall credit balance reached 5.2% in November. Considering only private individuals operations, this ratio presented a small increase, reaching 6.9% compared to 6.8% in October. 
The investment is another demand component that has performed favorably. The indicators still registered, in the last months, expansion of the production capacity of all sectors of the economy and the adaptation to the energy crisis. The composition of the growth rate of the production of capital goods showed the predominance of equipment related to the electric power generation, the civil construction sector and the agricultural activity. The demand for electric power generators will drop in the coming months, due to the reduction of the rationing targets. Nevertheless, the expectation of a hike in electricity tariffs will attenuate that reduction, by stimulating the search for energy self-sufficiency by industries. The production of agricultural equipment in the last few years has improved with the continuous expansion in grain crops, as well as other agricultural products, a trend expected to continue in 2002. In relation to the civil construction industry, the gap between the growth of production of equipment used by the sector and its modest performance in the last few years indicates favorable conditions for a future recovery. 
Concerning the industrial sector, the analysis of production indicators in recent months shows that the negative effects from the constraints on electricity supply were absorbed. The 1.9% contraction in the October production, seasonally adjusted, resulted to a great extent from the strike of the petrol sector workers, affecting the mining industry and the production of the chemical industry. These effects apart, the variation of the industrial production in October is still negative, but close to zero, compatible with the scenario of leveling off of the industrial activity present since August. It is worth observing that, in spite of the unfavorable outcome in that month, twelve out of the 21 surveyed industrial sectors increased their production. Year to date, the results remained positive, with a 2.5% increase compared to the first ten months of 2000. 
In November, the automobile industry produced 153.5 thousand vehicles, expanding by 8.5% year-to-date. Notwithstanding the seasonal influences, the monthly growth was 12.6%. Sales reached 148.1 thousand vehicles, an increase of 13.2% in the period (seasonally adjusted series). The production of agricultural machinery and equipment grew for the third consecutive month, registering a 1.6% elevation. The 25.1% increase ytd suggests the continuity of the increase of the agricultural productivity for the next crop, now being sowed. 
The utilization rate of installed capacity, which had declined strongly in the months in which the restraints on energy supply were more intense, reflected the recent leveling off of the industrial production. Year to September the intensity of the reduction in the usage of industrial capacity fell, a process that presented signs of reversion in October, according to the statistics from the Federation of Industries of the State of São Paulo (FIESP) and the National Confederation of Industries (CNI), which registered utilization rates of industrial capacity of 79.4% and 79.6%, respectively, in the seasonally adjusted series. 
The developments in the labor market reflected the lesser impact to the domestic and external shocks on industrial activity, the prospect of the end of economic deceleration, and the beginning of recovery. In industry, surveys revealed a lower number of dismissals than suggested by economic forecasts at the beginning of the electricity rationing, and October indicators point to the end of this trend. The open unemployment rate, calculated by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) for six Metropolitan Regions, reached 6.55% in October, compared to 6.15% in September, an increase originated from the 0.45% growth in the Economically Active Population (PEA), as the number of occupied workers remained stable. Data from the Ministry of Labor still indicated growth of the formal employment in October, as observed since the beginning of the year. The total number of formal labor positions in October corresponded to 23,830 thousand, increasing by 0.34% in comparison to the previous month and 2.94% ytd. 
As for the financial system indicators, the outstanding balance of credit operations registered a 0.2% growth in November, reaching R$ 336.1 billion. This performance was basically due to the 1.1% fall in the operations with freely allocated resources, which represented 58.6% of the total operations, as compared with the 2.9% seasonal growth of resources directed to the rural sector, as well as the 7.3% expansion of on-lendings for investments from the National Bank of Economic and Social Development (BNDES). 
The reduction of the stock of credit with freely allocated resources originated, to a great extent, from the appreciation of the Real in the period, affecting operations linked to the exchange rate and inducing the 1.6% reduction in the balance of operations with corporations. Regarding the 0.2% fall observed in the credit to private individuals, it is worth emphasizing the smaller use of overdraft accounts, in view of the increase of family incomes resulting from the receipt of part of the 13th salary in November. 
With reference to the foreign trade, a US$ 129 million surplus was obtained in the trade balance in the month up to the second week of December, increasing the year-to-date surplus to US$ 1.9 billion. The positive result of the trade balance throughout the year is mainly reflecting the reduction of imports, as a consequence of the exchange rate depreciation and the deceleration of domestic economic activity, and the expansion of exports, particularly basic products, as the exports of manufactured products grow at a less accelerated rate due to the contraction of important markets for Brazil such as Argentina and the European Union. The continuity of the growth of sales to the USA should be highlighted, in spite of the deceleration of that economy, plus the gradual incorporation and expansion of sales to new markets in Asia, Africa, Eastern Europe and the Middle East. 
Thus, the current account deficit showed a declining trend, while foreign direct investments, an important source of funds to finance the balance of payments, reached US$ 2.2 billion in November, the highest result of the year, compared to a monthly average of US$ 1.4 billion in the period, August to October. 
In summary, the evaluation of the recent performance of the indicators, both from the demand side and from the production sectors, permits the conclusion that that the economy has overcome, to a great extent, the negative effects related to the rationing of electricity supply and to the adversities of the international scenario, as demonstrated by the stability of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the third quarter of the year, compared to the previous one, seasonal influences apart. The sustained dynamism of the domestic activity is also worth mentioning, furthermore thanks to the continuity of investments, the increases of agricultural income and the recovery in consumption, contributing to a gradual recovery in the growth trend. 
Indicators recently released show that the world macroeconomic scenario is one of deceleration with reduction in inflationary pressure and low confidence of the agents, despite the efforts of the larger economies to adopt expansionist monetary and fiscal policies. 
The U.S. economic indicators reinforce the decelerating trend of the expansion of economic activity, although at varying rates depending on the characteristics of each economic sector. In the third quarter, U.S. GDP contracted by 1.1%, reflecting reductions of 10.7% in private investment, and of 17.7% in exports. Consumption, which used to support outcome, expanded by 1.1%, and government expenditures grew by 0.8%, decelerating as compared with the previous quarter. From the supply side, factors of production are migrating from goods production to the services sector. In the job market, the increase in the unemployment rate observed in the last months is linked to the deterioration of corporate results, whose profits declined significantly in the third quarter. The job market is expected to remain in decline, as corporations adjust their costs by cutting investment and dismissing employees. 
Agents' expectations surveyed among entrepreneurs (NAPM) and consumers (Conference Board) were distinct from each other in November. Expectations of manufacturers recovered in November, after the drop in October, but were still below 50 points, for the 16th consecutive month, indicating retraction. The index that measures consumer confidence contracted 31.8 points from August to November, reflecting the uncertainties about the economic scenario in the short run. This suggests that the U.S. economy will not bounce back quickly. 
The propagation of economic fragility helps to maintain inflation under control. Inflation is showing signs of deceleration. The CPI rose by 1.9% in the 12 months ending in November, as compared to 2.13% in October and 3.62% in May. The CPI core in November, however, grew by 0.37% compared to 0.16% in October. Price increases were considered as normal for the period and will not translate into inflationary pressure in the coming months. 
The U.S. economic scenario does not show consistent signs of recovery of the level of activity. Market forecasts indicate sustained growth recovery only after the third quarter of 2002. 
The economies in the Euro area continue to present deceleration in their growth rate of economic activity. The latter is made worse by the retraction in world demand, which may revert the upward trend of the regional trade balance, as a result of unfavorable forecasts for business. The deceleration in the Harmonized CPI, which is in a converging trend to the annual reference of 2%, may lead the European Central Bank to ease monetary policy, in an attempt to bring dynamism to regional economic activity. An expansionist fiscal policy could be limited by the public deficit ceilings imposed by the Maastricht criteria. 
In Japan, main demand and supply indicators point to the deepening of recession. The maintenance of the zero interest rate monetary policy, associated to expansionist fiscal measures, are not producing positive results. Industrial production maintains a declining trend having reached in October a 12-month accumulated variation of -11.9%, one of the lowest levels since 1988. 
The economic deceleration simultaneously observed in the more developed economies reflects on the performance of the emerging markets. In China and in Korea, domestic demand sustains economic growth, compensating the retraction in external demand. The approval of China’s entry to the WTO, on November 10, means that export markets will be widened, as well as imposing new challenges due to the deep transformation that will occur in key sectors of the Chinese economy. In Turkey, the IMF emphasized the good results of the fiscal efforts taken by the government and the advances in the restructuring of the banking sector. The IMF announced that it intends to negotiate additional US$10 billion financing for Turkey, to permit the compliance with external financing needs in 2001 and in 2002, widened due to the effects of the September 11 events. 
In Argentina, the deepening of the recession is a scenario of difficult solution. The deterioration of public accounts and the several economic packages in the last months failed to reestablish market confidence and barely contributed to the recovery of economic activity. The degree of popular dissatisfaction was shown through pillaging in the capital and in the main cities, leading to a decreed state of siege and the resignation of the Minister of Finance. 
In November, the inflation rates measured by the main price indices declined. The Consumer Price Index - Extended (IPCA) varied 0.71%, compared to 0.83% in October, accumulating 6.98% in 2001 and 7.61% in the last twelve months. The smaller monthly variation of the IPCA was mainly due to the lower impacts of cigarette and fuel price increases, both occurred at the beginning of October. The reduction of the rate was not more intense due to increases of the expenditures with food, mainly cereals and meat, to the adjustments of electricity tariffs in the cities of Rio de Janeiro and Porto Alegre, as well as to the increase in urban bus tariffs, also in Rio. 
The General Price Index – Domestic Supply (IGP-DI) showed a 0.76% variation in November, compared to 1.45% in October, accumulating 10.18% in the year and 11.02% in 12 months. Relative to the previous month, the variation of the Consumer Price Index (IPC-DI) accelerated 0.85% compared to 0.71%, mainly due to increases of administered prices in Rio de Janeiro, more intensively impacting on the IPC rather than the IPCA, in addition to the residual effect of cigarette prices in October. The slowdown in the variation of the Wholesale Price Index (IPA-DI), 0.73% in November compared to 1.88% in October, was the main reason for the behavior of the index in the month. The 0.93% hike in agricultural prices and the 0.65% increase in industry prices, 1.74% and 1.94%, respectively, in October, led to this deceleration in the Wholesale prices. The National Index of Civil Construction (INCC-DI) increased by 0.74%, from 0.93% in the previous month. 
For the coming months more favorable forecasts are being made. Many factors are contributing to this, such as the recent behavior of the exchange rate, the deceleration observed in the agricultural prices, namely cereals and meat, the absence of strong pressures from administered prices and the prospect of reduction in fuel prices. Thus, even if there are, in the next few months, seasonal pressures from the readjustments of school monthly payments and increase in domestic gas and electricity prices, the aforementioned factors should prevail, allowing for a decrease in the inflation rates.
The yield curve showed higher volatility since the last Copom meeting. After the declarations of the Central Bank board confirming that it will firmly pursue the achievement of the 2002 inflation target and also after the announcement of the firm offer of 16-month LTN, the slope of the curve increased, with the spread between the one-year interest rate and the Over-Selic rate rising to 418 basis points on November 29th, the auction date, from 186 basis points on November 21st. The perception of an improvement in the domestic economy due to the appreciation of the Real against the U.S. dollar, the positive results of the trade balance, and the announcement of the external funding, favored the partial reversion of the trend of the interest rate slope, reducing this spread to 239 basis points on December 14th. 
The Central Bank carried out buyback auctions of NBCE simultaneously with the selling auctions of NTN-D from the National Treasury, aiming at partially redistributing the redemption of NBCEs that will take place between February and April 2002. The net financial impact of this operation was neutral due to the purchase of R$1.1 billion of NBCE and the sale of R$1.1 billion of 3-year and 5-year NTN-D (64% and 36% of the total, respectively). The auctions indicated a stronger demand from the market for the reversion of the positions of shorter-term exchange rate indexed securities than opening positions in longer tenures. 
Within the period, there was also the rollover of exchange rate indexed securities maturing on 2 different dates. The strategy adopted was based on the full rollover of the principal added to the final interest payments through the placement of 3-year and 5-year NTN-D. The total placement reached R$2.2 billion, with the 3-year securities representing around 70% of the total. 
Since November 27th, there have been 7 auctions of LTN. The National Treasury promoted the lengthening of the issuance tenure, placing 16-month securities. These LTN were auctioned on three different dates, the first one being through a firm offer. The average interest rates ranged from 24.7% to 21.87%, while the demand/supply ratio ranged between 1.2 and 2.9. There were also 4 offers of 6-month securities. The upward trend in the average interest rates observed for the first 2 events (20.41% and 20.89%) were reverted in the last 2 auctions (20.18% and 20.35%). The demand/supply ratio ranged between 1.3 and 1.8. The resulting financial volume of the placements transacted reached R$8.1 billion, of which 91% referring to securities maturing in six months. 
Considering the financial settlements occurred between November 21st and December 18th, there was monetary expansion of R$3.3 billion. This impact resulted, mainly, from the net redemptions of LTN (1.6 billion), LFT (R$0.8 billion) and exchange rate indexed securities (R$1.1 billion). 
During a 20 working day period, the Central Bank intervened thirteen times in the open market, aiming at administering the very short-term interest rate. In all operations, the Central Bank provided liquidity to the market at a hurdle yield of 19.05% p.a. The average volume of the interventions was of R$16 billion. 
In November, the secondary market showed a growth in the trading of fixed rate securities compared to the previous month, with an average daily turnover of LTN growing to R$3.9 billion from R$2.5 billion, due to the increase in the volume of primary offers (to R$7.6 billion in November, from R$5 billion in October), to a more favorable economic scenario and to the expectations of a reduction in interest rates in the medium term. 
The 6.6% appreciation of the Real in November was the main factor explaining the R$10.2 billion (-1.6%) reduction of in the domestic securitized debt and also the decline in the share of the debt indexed to the exchange rate to 31.1% from 32.9% in the previous month. 
The identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed in light of newly available information. The scenario considered in the simulations contemplates the following hypotheses: 
1. November inflation rate, measured by the IPCA, reached 0.71%, a result higher than expected, 
2. Regarding oil by-products, the hypothesis assumed was that, with the opening of the domestic market in January 2002, the prices of oil by-products will be determined by market forces, floating in accordance with supply and demand conditions. The forecast for gasoline, diesel oil and GLP prices for January 2002 were calculated by applying the price variation coefficient in Reais of December compared to November 2001 on the effective prices prevailing in December 2001. For the rest of 2002, the hypothesis assumed the variations of the prices in the futures market of Brent crude oil negotiated in the International Petroleum Exchange (IPE) for gasoline and diesel, and the future contracts of propane gas on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) for GLP. For GLP, the hypothesis of elimination of subsidies was incorporated. Thus, in contrast with what should occur with the other oil by-products, domestic gas should increase by 16.4% in first quarter and 15.2% throughout the year. Even though this increase will be substantial, it is more than compensated by the average reduction expected for the prices of gasoline and diesel oil for consumers in 2002, 
3. The projection for the readjustment of electricity tariffs in 2001 remained at approximately 20%. For 2002, the forecast of the readjustment was reduced to 19%, 
4. For the wider set of administered prices, the 10.7% readjustment in 2001 remained practically unchanged in relation to the previous month. For 2002, the expected readjustment is of 5.2%, 
5. The projected slope of the domestic yield curve, measured as the difference between 180-day term DI rate and 1-day Selic rate, was significantly reduced to an average of 290 b.p. for the fourth quarter of 2001, declining to100 b.p. in the second quarter of 2002, 
6. The trend of the US Fed Funds rate, forecast based on the maturity of future contracts, was modified to reflect an average rate of 2.15% in the fourth quarter of 2001, declining to 1.75% in the first quarter of 2002, with a moderate rise thereafter,
7. On the external front, the assumption for the average risk premium using Brazil’s Global 04 Bonds incorporates a declining path from current levels to a plateau close to 700 b.p. from the first quarter of 2002 on, with stability thereafter.
The core inflation of the IPCA, calculated under the symmetric trimmed-mean method, rose in November to 0.77%, from 0.57% in October. Accumulated in 12 months, this core index increased by 7.05%. The core inflation of the IPC-BR, calculated under the symmetric trimmed-mean method, rose in November to 0,77%. Accumulated in 12 months, this core recorded a 6.87% variation. The core inflation calculated with the exclusion of the administered prices - considering the wide set of these items weighting 30.7% of the IPCA in November - and household food prices increased by 0.68% in November, with accumulated variation of 4.85% in 12 months. 
The IPCA accumulated variation year-to-date reached 6.98% in October, reflecting a 2.9% contribution (10.0% variation) from administered prices and 4.1% contribution (5.7% variation) from free prices. A 0.2% contribution (0.7% variation) is expected from administered prices for the rest of the year. The evolution of these prices should directly contribute with 3.1% for the yearly inflation, compared to the 3.2% forecast in November. In 2002, the lower inflation of administered prices is due mainly to the readjustments of oil by-products prices, which will be determined by the market. It is expected a 5.2% increase of administered prices (direct contribution of 1.6%, which excludes the second-round effects on inflation), influenced by 19% hikes in electricity for the domestic consumer. 
Regarding fiscal policy, it was assumed that the primary surplus targets for the consolidated public sector stated in the Economic Program of the Government will be achieved. The remaining assumptions established in the previous meeting were maintained. 
Simulation exercises with several specifications of the structural model led to the conclusion that the maintenance of the interest rate at 19.0% p.a. and of the exchange rate at the same plateau as of the eve of the Copom meeting would result in an inflation over the upper limit of the target for 2001. For 2002, the projected inflation is closer to the medium range of a 3.5% target. For 2003, the projected inflation is significantly lower than the medium range target of 3.25%, using the scenario of constant interest rates at 19%. 
The economic scenario presented improvements since the last Copom meeting. The exchange rate appreciated quickly, in response to the positive evolution of the external accounts and the differentiation between the Brazil risk with Argentina's, which resulted in the reduction of the risk premium. Government forecasts for the readjustment of administered prices in 2002 were revised downward due to lower readjustments of the electricity tariffs, the liberalization of the market of oil derivatives and the changes in the taxation of this sector, which will revert into substantial price reductions. The reduction in the slope of the yield curve will have positive impacts on economic growth. 
Consistently with the favorable prospects expressed in the Minutes of the last Copom meeting, the indicators of economic activity in the third quarter signal a smooth recovery of the level of economic activity next year. Even being lower than the forecast at the beginning of the year, the GDP growth in 2001 will be close to 2% but slightly higher in 2002. In the third quarter, the economy grew by 0.3% compared to the previous quarter (2.17% ytd). The agriculture and livestock activity contributed positively to the GDP growth, offsetting the negative evolution of the industrial sector. The industrial production, measured by IBGE's Monthly Survey of Industries (PIM) declined by 3.4% in the month, seasonally adjusted figures. In 2001, the investment rate will be higher than 23% of GDP. More pronounced increases in investment will be observed in the sectors of capital goods related to agricultural tractors, high tension transformers, railway wagons, and equipment for the civil construction industry. 
The Balance of Payment accounts improved. The trade balance has accumulated a US$1.9 billion surplus ytd until the second week of December, explained by the depreciation of the Real in the second and third quarters. For the first time since 1994, the trade balance will finish the year with a positive result. The foreign direct investment registered higher than expected net inflows of US$2.2 billion in November, and will finish the year with net inflows higher than US$20 billion. In addition, the external funding, which was hindered by September 11 events, was reactivated by private firms. This set of favorable factors contributed to the reversal of the depreciating trend of the Real. 
Market expectations for inflation, surveyed by the Central Bank, for the next quarters have been declining in the past weeks. This movement may be partly associated with the recently observed appreciating trajectory of the exchange rate. In the case of this trend persisting, the prospects for inflation may show additional decline, since the risk of the passthrough of the exchange rate depreciation accumulated this year to next year’s inflation also declines. Noteworthy is that a significant part of the difference between Copom's projections and the market ones is explained by a more depreciated trajectory of the exchange rate used by the market. 
The world scenario is uncertain. The deceleration of the world economy, intensified by the recession in the USA and the by the persistence of recession in Japan reinforce the perception that a recovery of the economy of industrialized countries will be postponed to the second half of 2002. This set of uncertainties, aggravated by the worsening of the Argentine economy, reflects in unfavorable expectations for the exchange rate and the inflation in 2002. 
November inflation measured by the IPCA, as well as its core, remained at a high level. The exchange rate passthrough and the decompression of the profit margins seem to be the responsible for the high increases in the consumer price indices and yet the degree of influence of these factors in the next few months is uncertain, mainly in a context of economic recovery. Nonetheless, the four-week index, measured by the IPC-Fipe, already points to a reversal trend. 
In summary, a sum of factors contributes to a scenario of interest rate reduction in the coming years. The simulation exercises with the various specifications of the structural model points to inflation near the medium range target in 2002. However, the uncertainties regarding the recovery of the international economy, the improvement in the inflation indices due to a lower passthrough of the exchange rate depreciation, and the evolution of the Argentine crisis recommend that we wait for a confirmation of the more favorable scenario that starts to materialize.
"
04/02/2002;67;Arminio Fraga;"The indicators of economic activity, at the end of 2001, showed continuity of the process of overcoming the factors that provoked the economic deceleration beginning in April 2001. The more favorable scenario for demand expansion is basically endorsed by the reduction in default rates and more favorable consumer inclination. However, these conditions, as well as labor market ones, favored a gradual recovery in consumption, as indicated by December sales, which should avoid pressures on prices in the future. 
Preliminary data on the turnover of the retail commerce in the Metropolitan Region of São Paulo showed stability in December, after four consecutive months of growth. If confirmed, this indicator, as surveyed by the São Paulo State’s Federation of Commerce (FCESP), will have decreased by 5.2% in 2001. This fall is partially explained by the high basis of comparison of the second half of 2000. 
The Index of Consumer intentions (IIC), also surveyed by FCESP, increased in January for the third consecutive time, reflecting improvement in the two components of this indicator, actual and future consumption intentions. Although the index has not yet reached the optimism level (index above 100), these results indicate a gradual recovery of consumers’ perception on the consequences of the domestic and external shocks. 
The evolution of default rates contributed to favoring retailers' turnover. In December, the net rate of default, based on information of the São Paulo Trade Association (ACSP), decreased to 2.3%, compared to 8.4% in November, mainly due to the increase in debt cancellations. The ratio of checks returned due to insufficient funds in total discounted checks declined to 4.9% in December, compared to 5.2% in November. 
Regarding company inventory levels, the indicators showed a reduction in the levels of the fourth quarter of 2001 compared to the previous one, for the majority of economy’s segments, according to private surveys. Considering the general indicator, it should be noted that, compared to the same period in the previous year, the index remained at a level significantly higher in the second and third quarters of 2001, reflecting the shocks that occurred in that period. In the last quarter, the indicator reached the same level as in the fourth quarter of 2000, showing a return to normal levels for the period. 
Seasonally adjusted industrial production increased by 1.5% in November, after falling by 1.9% in October, which was partially explained by the petroleum workers’ strike in that month. Production of consumer goods increased by 3.6%, reflecting a 6.9% expansion in the production of durable goods and a 3.8% increase in the production of semi-durable and non-durable goods. Year-to-date up to November, overall industry grew by 2.1% compared to the same period of 2000. 
Statistics of the automobile industry revealed growth of 3.8% in the production of vehicles and of 2% in agricultural machinery in December, seasonal effects excluded. The total yearly production reached 1,793 thousand vehicles and 44.5 thousand units of agricultural machinery, which surpassed the total in 2000 by 6.6% and 25.3%, respectively. 
Following the performance of the activity level, the indicators of the labor market presented a favorable evolution. The open unemployment rate assessed by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), based on a survey by domiciles in six metropolitan regions, reached 6.4% in November, after reaching 6.55% in October. The fall was due to the 0.25% rise in job offers, which surpassed the 0.11% growth of the Economically Active Population (PEA). Similar evolution was indicated by the data from the Ministry of Labor and Employment, which continued to indicate growth in formal employment in November of 0.2%, considering the series excluding seasonal effects. The total number of formal jobs created up to November reached 845 thousand, with growth of 4% in commerce, 3.8% in services, and 3% in industry. The civil construction sector was the only one to present a decline in employment level ( 0.7%). CNI and Fiesp surveys, however, have shown reduction in industrial employment, which reached, in November, 0.3% and 0.45%, respectively. 
Regarding the demand for investments, despite the falls observed in the last three months (seasonally adjusted data), the production of capital goods reached an accumulated growth of 14.1% in the year, up to November, due principally to the growth of agriculture, transport and electric power generating equipment. On the other hand, the production levels of civil construction showed an accumulated fall of 1.8%, also up to November. The recent fall in the production of capital goods, allied with the unfavorable performance of the construction sector, will reduce the share of gross capital formation in the GDP in the last months of the year. 
The level of utilization of installed capacity declined once more in November after recovering in October. According to CNI statistics, which take into account information for twelve States, the average level of utilization reached 79.0% in November, compared to 79.5% in the previous month (seasonally adjusted data). The processing industry of the State of São Paulo also presented a lower level of utilization, falling by 0.4%, using the same basis of comparison. 
In December, new loan concessions by the financial system with its free resources grew by 1.6%. The operations with corporations increased by 4.2%, with special attention to the operations linked to external resources, which increased by 18.3%. Loans to private individuals declined by 3.8%, due to a seasonal decrease in demand for credit of the financial system, as a result of the payment of the 13th-salary. This reduction affected mainly the rotating credit lines of overdraft accounts and credit cards. 
The stock of credit granted by the financial system declined by 1.3% in December, as a result of the 2.2% fall in the stock of operations with free resources. This performance is associated with a lower demand for rotating credit lines for private individuals, which caused the 0.9% reduction in the volume negotiated with private individuals, as well as the exchange rate appreciation – affecting the operations referenced in foreign currency – leading to a 3% reduction in the volume of credit for corporations. 
Regarding the external transactions of the Brazilian economy, the trade balance registered a surplus of US$ 857 million in December, the best monthly result since the implementation of the Real Plan. This result created an accumulated trade balance of US$ 2.7 billion in 2001. The surprising performance of the trade balance in December reflected, mainly, a 28.3% retraction in imports compared to the same month of 2000, since exports fell by 6.7% in comparison with the same month in the previous year. A retraction in expending was observed in all categories of usage, with especially with raw materials and intermediate goods, which declined by 32.8%. 
The 5.8% increase in exports in 2001 reflected, to a great extent, the exceptional performance of sales of basic products, which contributed with 88.6% to the increase in revenues. Regarding imports, a 0.5% decline in spending was observed, especially as a result of the 4% retraction in expenditure with raw materials and intermediate goods. 
In the first three weeks of January 2002, the trade balance accumulated a surplus of US$ 12 million. The higher growth of the world economy in 2002 should favor the expansion of Brazilian exports and the trade balance compared to 2001. In spite of the likely decrease in exports to Argentina, the expansion to new markets is estimated to offset the loss of revenue, a repetition of the behavior observed in 2001. 
Foreign direct investment was among the main sources of financing of the balance of payments at the end of 2001 reaching US$ 3.9 billion, more than enough to cover the current account deficit of US$ 1.8 billion. In 2001, foreign direct investment defrayed almost all current account deficit (97.5%). Noteworthy was also the issuance of Republic Bonds, Global 2012, to the value of US$ 1.25 billion, at a 10-year tenure, as part of the Central Government funding expected to reach up to US$ 5 billion in the year. 
In summary, the economic indicators show gradual and consistent overcoming of the adversities which hit the economy in 2001. This perception has been reflecting on consumer confidence level, which has been increasing since last October. The level of inventory in the last quarter of 2001 declined in relation to the preceding one, default rates in December reached the lowest level of the last five years and demand is signaling a gradual recovery. These facts reinforce the prospect of the renewal of economic activity, which in turn should not affect the positive outlook of the balance of trade in 2002 as the improvement of growth of the external markets becomes stronger. 
Recent world macroeconomic statistics still do not clearly show consistent reversion of the recession in the short term. However, evidence of recovery can be noticed in the main developed economies, except for Japan. On the other hand, the deterioration of the Argentine economy adds uncertainties to the external scenario. 
Despite the continued decline of the U.S. activity level, some indicators point to a phasing out of the recession process. Inventory reduced for the 10th consecutive month, registering 1% in December. This fact may contribute to the recovery of the industrial production, which will also depend on consumer behavior in the coming months. Industrial production in December presented the lowest rate of decline in the past six months (0.1%). Year-to-date, the retraction was 3.8%, the first since 1990 and the highest since 1982, when the industrial production declined by 5.4%. In November, factory orders – excluding the sector of military defense – increased for the 2nd consecutive month, which may be a sign of recovery in the manufacturing sector. Retail sales decreased by 0.3% in December, less than expected by the market. They were favored by the increase of the volume of transactions in the electronic, clothing and furniture sectors. Other factors, such as the persistent soundness of the housing sector and the increase of the consumer's confidence index lead to a more optimistic perspective for the U.S. economy in the next months. 
The main economies of the Euro area, Germany and France, presented signs of recovery in the activity level. In Germany, industrial orders rose in November for the first time in three months, due to the increase in external demand. In addition, retail sales in November were above expectations, recording a 1.6% expansion compared to October. This result may be reflecting a greater enthusiasm of consumers, as tracked by a survey that displayed the first improvement for four months. In France, the industrial production remained stable in November after two months of retraction, while consumer expenditure grew for the 2nd consecutive month. Hence, in the light of the growing evidence of reactivation of the region's economy and of the perception that the current level of interest rates is consistent with the price stability target, there is the possibility that the expansionary monetary policy adopted in 2001 will be suspended, as long as the indications of a scenario of gradual recovery persists. 
The Japanese economy has remained stagnant for a long time and has not responded to the stimuli from the economic policy. In the last BoJ meeting, on 1.16.2002, the monetary policy remained unchanged, but there is a possibility of a liquidity expansion at the end of their fiscal year, on 3.31.2002, with new assistance to banks with solvency problems. 
The main inflation indices presented lower increases in December, compared to the previous month. The Consumer Price Index – Extended (IPCA) increased by 0.65%, compared to 0.71% in November. The IPCA reached 7.67% in the year, reflecting mainly the 10.45% rise in the prices of goods and services administered by contracts. The segments that presented variation above the index average were: food and beverage (9.63%), especially beef (12.17%), bread (22.09%), meals (11.93%), rice (43.59%) and black beans (162.36%), housing (9.4%), in which the items electricity (17.93%), water and sewage tariff (15.5%) and bottled gas (15.6%) are considered, and transport (8%), specially urban transport (15.54%) and gasoline (7.19%). In addition to the adjustments of the prices administered by contracts, these increases also reflected the exchange rate devaluation occurred in the year, as well as the unfavorable climatic conditions for the production of rice and black beans. 
In December, the IPCA increase was mainly due to the rise in the prices administered by contracts (electricity and urban transport tariffs in Rio de Janeiro), clothing, medicines, poultry and new cars, partially offset by the decline in the prices of milk, beans, bottled gas and gasoline. 
The General Price Index – Domestic Supply (IGP-DI) presented a more intense fall in the monthly variation, reaching 0.18% in December compared to 0.76% in November, and accumulated 10.4% in 2001. Compared to November, the variation of the Consumer Price Index (IPC-DI) declined to 0.7% from 0.85% due to the smaller increase of the "miscellaneous expenditure" group. It should also be pointed out the smaller increase in the prices of the housing and transport groups. The 0.09% fall in the Wholesale Price Index (IPA-DI), compared to the 0.73% rise in November, is the reason for most of the deceleration of the IGP-DI in the month. The IPA evolution reflected a fall of 0.32% in the industrial IPA, basically due to the exchange rate appreciation in the period, with the agricultural IPA increasing by 0.48%, against 0.93% in November. The National Index of Civil Construction (INCC-DI) also increased at a lower intensity, presenting a 0.34% variation, compared to 0.74% in November. 
In January, the consumer price indices should reflect increases in the prices of in natura products, poultry and eggs, as well as rises of 18.63% in the electricity tariff in Rio de Janeiro and of 15% in urban transport tariffs in Belo Horizonte. The price increase of bottled gas should also be highlighted as well as the seasonal increase in the cost of education. These upward effects should be partially offset by the fall in gasoline prices. 
For wholesale prices, the inflation indices should mainly reflect the rises of the prices of poultry, eggs, corn and beans, and the fall in industrial products caused, basically, by lower fuel prices and by the exchange rate appreciation. 
The yield curve showed smaller volatility since the last Copom Meeting. From the end of December on, the expectation of lower inflation in the first quarter of 2002, the trade balance results, and the placement of the global bonds led to a negative slope in the short part of the curve, with the spread between the 30-day interest rate and the Over-Selic rate falling to -12 basis points on January 3rd, from 19 basis points on December 20th. In the same way, within this period, the spread between the one-year interest rate and the Over-Selic rate narrowed to 39 basis points from 211 basis points. Subsequently, the release of higher than expected inflation rates and the environment of uncertainty due to the end of the bank holiday in Argentina caused the increase of the spread between the one-year interest rate and the Over-Selic rate to 180 basis points on January 15th. With the proximity of the Copom meeting, this spread fell to 102 basis points, due to the expectations of treasuries of some financial institutions that a reduction in the Over-Selic rate target might occur. 
The swap operation of exchange rate indexed securities was carried out once more, aiming at partially redistributing the redemptions in 2002. On January 17th, the Central Bank carried out buyback auctions of NBCE with redemptions between February and April 2002, simultaneously with the selling auctions of National Treasury's NTN-D. The net financial impact of this operation was neutral on the market due to the purchase of R$ 1.9 billion of NBCE and the sale of same amount of NTN-D with redemption in 2-years (38% of the total), 3 years (36% of the total) and 6 years (26% of the total). Hence, as observed in the December operation, the auctions indicated a more significant market demand for the reversion of positions in shorter exchange rate indexed securities than for the opening of longer maturities positions. 
The National Treasury has been promoting the lengthening of fixed-rate debt that began in November. Since January 8th, 6-month and 15-month securities were offered on three occasions. The upward trend in the yields observed at the beginning of the month was reverted in the most recent auction, declining from the previous one. The average yields were of 19.10%, 19.79% and 19.47%, respectively, for the shortest-tenure securities, and of 20.45%, 21.72% and 20.79% for the longest. The resulting financial volume of the placements reached R$ 6.8 billion, of which 80% referred to the shortest-tenure securities. 
Considering the financial settlements occurred between December 19th and January 22nd, there was a monetary expansion of R$ 7.2 billion, resulting from the net redemptions of LTN (R$ 3.6 billion), of LFT (R$ 1.4 billion) and of the payment of intermediate interest on NTN-C (R$ 0.6 billion) and of exchange rate indexed securities (R$ 1.6 billion) 
During the 22 working day period, the Central Bank intervened fourteen times in the open market, aiming at administering the very short-term interest rate. In thirteen interventions, the Central Bank provided liquidity to the market at a hurdle yield of 19.05% p.a., with an average volume of R$ 13.3 billion. In addition, there was an intervention to withdraw liquidity from the market at a hurdle yield of 18.9% p.a., which reached R$ 1.4 million. 
In December, the secondary market registered growth in the traded volume of exchange rate indexed securities and of LFT, mainly as a result of the need for adjustment in the positions of some investment funds. The daily average turnover of exchange rate indexed securities increased to R$ 2.5 billion from R$ 1.6 billion, while the LFT turnover grew to R$ 2.9 billion from R$ 1.7 billion. 
On the other hand, the fixed-rate securities showed stability compared to the previous month, with a daily average turnover of R$ 3.8 billion, despite the decline in the volume of the primary offers (to R$ 6.0 billion in December, from R$ 7.3 billion in November). 
As occurred in November, the significant appreciation of the Real allowed for a R$ 16.2 billion reduction, in December, of the share of the domestic securitized debt indexed to the exchange rate, reducing its relative share in the total to 28.6% from 31.1%. 
The identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed in the light of newly available information. The scenario considered in the simulations assumes the following hypotheses: 
1. December inflation rate, measured by the IPCA, registered a 0.65% increase. Despite the high result, it was lower than the observed in November, 
2. The forecasts for gasoline and diesel oil prices for 2002 and 2003 were calculated based on the surveys of National Petroleum Agency (ANP), which indicate significant price reductions in the first weeks of January. From that moment on, the projections were based on the behavior of the futures market of Brent crude oil negotiated in the International Petroleum Exchange (IPE). Regarding bottled gas (GLP), the elimination of subsidies caused an increase in the price of bottled gas in January. After that, the price behavior was projected based on the future contracts of propane gas negotiated on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), 
3. For the wider set of prices administered by contracts, the expected readjustments are 5.4% in 2002 and 3.4% in 2003, 
4. The projection for the readjustment of electricity tariffs in 2002 was slightly increased to 20.4%, due to the 2.9% increase occurred in the last days of 2001, which is reflected in the inflation of January 2002, 
5. As regards the slope of the domestic yield curve, measured as the difference between the 180-day term DI rate and the 1-day Selic rate, the average assumed increases to above 100 b.p. at the end of 2002, from 50 b.p. in the first quarter of the year, 
6. The trajectory of US Fed Funds rate, forecast based on the maturity of future contracts, was changed to reflect an average rate of 1.75% in the first quarter of 2002, increasing to 2.25% in the last quarter of the year,
7. For the sovereign risk premium, using Brazil's Global 04 Bonds, a stable trend is projected at a level of 600 b.p.. 
The core inflation of the IPCA, calculated under the symmetric trimmed-mean method, remained at a high level in December, the same as in November (0.77%). In 2001, this core index rose by 7.48%. The core inflation of the IPC-BR, calculated under the symmetric trimmed-method, presented a reduction to 0.71% in December from 0.77% in November. Accumulated in the 12 months of 2001, this core increased by 7.09%. The core inflation calculated by excluding the prices administered by contracts (considering the wide set of these items weighting 30.6% of the IPCA in December) and household food prices increased by 0.83% in December, with an accumulated variation of 5.49% in 12 months. 
The IPCA variation in 2001 was of 7.67%, reflecting a 2.4% contribution from freely established prices and a 1.7% contribution from prices administered by contracts, excluded the effects of the exchange rate pass-through and inflationary inertia. The exchange rate pass-through contributed with 2.9% to the 2001 inflation, and inertia contributed with 0.7%. In 2002, prices administered by contracts are expected to increase by 5.4% (with a 1.6% direct contribution), influenced by the increases in electricity tariffs. 
Regarding fiscal policy, the hypothesis of achieving the primary surplus targets for the consolidated public sector, as stated in the Economic Program of the Government, was maintained, as well as the remaining assumptions established in the previous meeting. 
The simulation exercises with several specifications of the structural model permitted a conclusion that favored the maintenance of the basic interest rate at 19.0 % p.a., and the exchange rate at the same plateau as on the eve of the Copom meeting, resulting in an inflation below 4.0% in 2002. For 2003, the inflation projected by the structural model based upon the hypothesis of maintenance of the interest rate at current levels and constant exchange rate is below the central target of 3.25%. 
The scenario of recovery of the activity level of the Brazilian economy seems to be consolidating, although slowly. The level of consumer confidence has been increasing since last October, which stimulates sales. The retailers' turnover, which had increased for four consecutive months, stabilized in December. This increase reduced inventories in the last quarter of 2001, compared to the previous quarter, indicating the prospect of recovery in industrial production. The industrial production, measured by the IBGE, grew in November, after declining in October (seasonally adjusted data). 
The existence of non-employed production capacity and the trajectory of the wage income indicate that the demand growth will not exert inflationary pressures. The increase in investment in capital goods observed in the first quarters of 2001 had the effect of increasing the installed capacity. The impact of the energy crisis has been smaller than expected, and the likely end of the energy rationing should enhance the potential growth of output. 
The recovery of the economic activity in Brazil has been compatible with the improvement in the external accounts. In 2001, the upturn of the trade balance and the maintenance of capital inflows in the form of foreign direct investment contributed to reduce Brazil' risk premium and to stabilize the Real. The surplus of US$ 2.7 billions in the trade balance in 2001 reflects a 5.8% increase in exports and a 0.7% decrease in imports. The net flow of foreign direct investment was US$ 22.6 billion, financing 97.5% of the current account deficit in the year and largely surpassing the previous projections. 
For this year, there are clearer signs that the recovery of the US economy, with positive impacts on the global economy, may start in the second quarter, what would stimulate exports and ease the financing of the Brazilian balance of payments. The Argentine crisis has had an additional but limited impact on the exchange rate and on the spread paid by the Brazilian bonds. 
As a result of the improvement of the economic scenario, as well as of the phasing out of the primary effects of the shocks occurred in 2001 and of the lower pressure from prices administered by contracts, the prospects for the inflation rate in 2002 and 2003 indicate a decline towards the target trajectories. This perception is shared by the economic agents, as indicated in the expectations for inflation in 2002 and 2003, as surveyed by the Investor Relations Group (GCI) of the Central Bank of Brazil. 
Nonetheless, some points of uncertainty remain in order to confirm this favorable outlook for inflation. Attention to the external scenario is essential, especially in regard to the aftermath of the Argentine crisis and the behavior of the flow of foreign capital, in the context of the domestic electoral process. In addition, attention is necessary to the likely additional pressures arising from the readjustments of prices administered by contracts this year and finally to the downward trajectory of inflation that has shown itself to be slower than expected. 
In fact, the reversal of the inflation trajectory has occurred slowly. Inflation measured by the IPCA remains high, despite having declined to 0.65% in December. The core inflation, measured by the trimmed-mean method, remains high in December. In January, the first signs point to a lower index, yet a relatively high one. Contributing to this results were: i) adverse climatic conditions which distinctly affected several regions (rain and drought) with upward impact on food prices, ii) the pressures to recompose profit margins and the second-round effects of the shocks - reflex of the inertia of the higher inflation in 2001, and iii) the movement of the slower drop in prices of oil-by-products. 
The contribution of the first-round effect of the shock from prices administered by contracts, in the share that exceeds the inflation target, once deducted from the impact of the exchange rate pass-through and of the inertia on the prices administered by contracts, is estimated at approximately 0.3 p.p. for the inflation in 2002. The inflationary inertia arising from a higher rate of inflation that exceeded the inflation target in 2001, contributed with a further 0.7 p.p.. The monetary policy should be oriented towards eliminating the second round effects of the shocks on inflation, preserving the initial relative price realignment. The monetary policy should, in addition, allow for an adequate period for inflation to return to its target trajectory, which depends on the magnitude of inherited inertia.
"
04/03/2002;68;Arminio Fraga;"Recent results of the performance of industry and commerce have confirmed the prospect of economic recovery signaled at the end of 2001. The improvements in consumer and business confidence revealed in the latest surveys on expectations indicate that this behavior show the likelihood of consolidating into a new trend of activity level. The intensity and the length of this movement will be conditioned to the growth of the real wage mass and to the evolution of the credit conditions, the main factors that support the demand. 
Preliminary figures released by São Paulo State’s Federation of Commerce (FCESP) about the retail commerce in the metropolitan region of São Paulo showed expansion of 2.1% in January (seasonally adjusted), compared to December. Excluding car dealers, whose sales dropped by 14.5% in the month, total turnover increased by 3.1%, driven by sales of durable consumer goods, which increased by 7.5% in the month, the sixth consecutive increase of this segment. Still in January, there was 2.4% rise in enquiries of check and credit sales, according to the São Paulo Trade Association (ACSP). It is the third consecutive month of expansion, which confirms the expansion of commerce. 
The upturn in the consumer expectations and the increase in sales promotions are considered to be the main reasons for the recent improved performance of the retail segment. The Index of Consumer Intentions (IIC), surveyed by FCESP, grew for the fourth consecutive month in February, registering an increase of 2.2%. The result mirrors the improvement of the two components of the index, current and future consumption intentions, highlighting the performance of the first component, whose increase reflected, mainly, the surpassing of the negative effects of the external scenario. Business expectations in relation to the current economic scenario are similar to consumers. The Confidence Index of the Industry, surveyed by CNI, indicated that, in January, most of industry, regardless the size of the company, significantly improved its perception of the economic conditions – the current and for the next months – for the Brazilian economy and for the sector in which their companies operate, compared to October’s survey. 
Regarding company inventories, data released by CNI point to a significant drop in the levels of stock of final goods, raw materials and intermediate goods in the fourth quarter of 2001. This data strengthens the perception of recovery in the industrial activity. 
The performance of the industrial production in December does in fact mirror in part this recovery identified in business expectations. According to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), the seasonally adjusted industrial production grew by 1% in December compared to November, accumulating an expansion of 1.5% in the year. The December result confirms the prospect of reversion of the declining trend that dominated the scenario in 2001, from March to October, by registering the second consecutive positive result after that period. The leadership of the consumption goods sector should be highlighted, in the recent recovery of the manufacturing sector, particularly durable goods, whose production grew by 6.1% in relation to November, accumulating an expansion of 11.3% in the last quarter of the year in relation to the previous quarter, considering seasonally adjusted data. The improvement in the economic scenario and the fulfillment of part of the demand restrained in the first months of electricity rationing explains this recovery, in addition to the relatively more attractive conditions of financing, particularly of new vehicles. 
The recent labor market indicators reinforce the expectations of recovery in the economic activity. According to seasonally adjusted indicators calculated by CNI, the industrial sector expanded its hours worked in production by 1.9% in 2001, in relation to 2000, and the number of employed people grew by 1.1%. The open unemployment rate calculated by the IBGE reached 5.6% in December compared to 6.4% in November. According to data from the Ministry of the Labor and Employment, the total number of formal jobs in the country grew by 2.6% in 2001. 
Still moving in the opposite direction to the expansion in the consumer goods sector, the production of capital goods declined for the fourth consecutive month in December, in comparison to the previous month. The performance of this category has a higher lag time compared to the changes in the activity level, as it depends on investment expenditures. Despite the weak results of the past months, a 12.8% expansion was registered in the year. It should be noted that imports of capital goods grew by 16.1% and the domestic absorption of capital goods increased by 18.7% in 2001, reflecting the investments in many sectors, mainly those associated with the overcoming the energy crisis and to the modernization of agriculture and the railway network. 
The balance of credit operations contracted by the financial system reached R$333.5 billion in January, representing a 0.3% growth in relation to the previous month. Of this total, R$195.8 billion refer to the credit operations contracted with freely allocated resources from the financial system, which grew by 1.6% in the same period, as a result of the 0.4% expansion in the volume of credit contracted by corporations and of 3.7% by private individuals. The slight growth of the credit stock directed to corporations resulted, basically, from the exchange rate depreciation which applies to operations linked to foreign currency, since the credit concessions directed to the production activity registered a 5.4% fall in the month. At the same time, the 5.2% growth in the demand for new finance on the part of private individuals reflected a higher concession in the modalities of overdraft and personal credit, after the seasonal fall at the end of the year. 
As to the external transactions of the Brazilian economy, the trade balance presented a US$175 million surplus in January, the first positive result for the month of January since 1997. Exports reached US$3,972 million, a 12.5% fall in relation to January 2001, while imports declined even more, 24.3%, totaling US$3,797 million. The 64.2% fall in the sales to Argentina was the main reason for the performance of the exports, but one should also consider the high comparative base of January 2001, when the international demand for soy meal and soybeans was high, creating shipments above the historical levels for the month. Regarding imports, all categories of products fell in relation to January 2001, at a moment of recovery of the domestic economy. Therefore, there are signs of imports substitution, mainly of raw materials and intermediate goods, by domestic production, due to the approximately 20% depreciation of the exchange rate. It should be emphasized that the purchases of industrial machinery and their accessories continued to expand, growing by 4.1% and 8.0%, respectively, indicating the maintenance of investments in production activity. The trade balance registered a US$100 million surplus up to the 17th February, with the daily average of exports and imports increasing by 6.0% and 4.4%, respectively, in relation to January. In February, there was a recovery in trade in terms of daily averages between Brazil-Argentina compared to January, with increases of 13.8% in exports and 25.4% in imports. 
In summary, the indicators of economic activity show a trend of recovery which initiated in the last months of 2001. Consumption, reflected in the indicators of retail commerce, continues to present positive results, influenced by the increase in consumer confidence and, due to the reduction in inventory levels observed at the end of 2001, this tends to stimulate industrial production in the coming months. The increase in production in the short term does not represent pressures originating from the increase in the level of utilization of installed capacity, considering the current level of idle capacity. Over a larger period of time, the growth of the activity level is sustainable in so much as it tends to be accompanied by productivity gains, coming from the larger flow of investments observed since 2000, and from the process of import substitutions, which reflects, amongst others, the evolution of the real exchange rate in the last months. 
In the United States, indicators continue to point to the recovery of activity. The U.S. GDP expanded by 0.2% in the 4th quarter of 2001, contrary to the expectations of a 1% fall and in line with the last economic activity indicators released. 
In the light of the improvement in the U.S. economy, but still highlighting the uncertainties, the Federal Reserve – FED decided to keep the interest rate unchanged at 1.75%, interrupting the trajectory of monetary policy loosening which had lasted for five consecutive meetings.. The FOMC report states that signs of the lowering of demand weakness are clearer and that the economic activity growth is starting to consolidate. 
The retail sales, not including car sales, presented a 1.2% seasonally adjusted growth in January compared to the previous month, signaling the highest increase since March 2000. This result overcame the expectations of a 0.4% contraction. However, taking into consideration car sales, this indicator fell by 0.2% in the seasonally adjusted series compared to December. 
The activity indicators surveyed by the Sales Management Institute show that industry and services maintain the trend of recovery. These indicators have been improving simultaneously with consumer confidence and with the labor market indicators, such as the unemployment rate, which declined in December. Recent information from the Labor Department indicates that the number of requests for unemployment insurance dropped for the fifth consecutive week. The deceleration of this indicator also suggests that the U.S. economy is starting to recover. 
The Japanese economy has been on a deflationary spiral, the main reason being the high volume of loans to which the banking system was committed, which is decapitalized and generates insufficient profits to cover the deterioration of the loans granted. 
In the Euro area, the European Central Bank kept the basic interest rate unchanged at 3.25% p. y.. According to the institution, the current level of interest rate is consistent with price stability, although the preliminary data of January has indicated a slight increase in inflation in the region, 2.5% in annualized terms, compared to 2.1% in December. According to the European Central Bank, this increase in inflation was mainly due to transitory and non-recurring factors, amongst which are the climatic conditions in some parts of Europe, causing an increase in food prices, anticipated influence of the indirect taxes, and the increase in the price of energy, in addition to the effects of the adaptation of the price system of a number of countries to the euro. 
The first more positive signs in the direction of a possible recovery in the major world economies, especially in the United States, show that they have reached the end of a recessive trend observed since the end of the first quarter of 2001. The recovery of the U. S. economy will have a positive impact both to world trade and in the normalization of the international capital markets, with the decline in intensity of the "flight to quality" movement predominant in 2001. Nonetheless, a more vigorous growth of the world output and trade may be relatively restricted by the permanence of Japan in recession, with repercussion throughout Asia. 
The Consumer Price Index – Extended (IPCA) increased by 0.52% in January, compared to 0.65% in December, accumulating a 7.62% variation in the last twelve months up to January. In spite of being in decline, the monthly result was influenced by the 0.85% rise in food prices, particularly in natura products, due to the unfavorable climate conditions, whereas the group of prices administered by contracts contributed with 0.11 of a percentage point, since the fall of prices of gasoline was more than offset by the increase in other important items, such as bottled gas, electricity and urban transport. 
Prices of non-food products increased by 0.42% in January. Gasoline was 9.92% cheaper to consumers, but the removal of subsidies caused a 17.87% rise in bottled gas prices. The 4.51% variation in electricity was due to the 18.63% readjustment made by the concessionaire in Rio de Janeiro, in addition to the non-recurrent 2.9% readjustment granted on December 27th, in most of the surveyed areas. The item urban transport registered a 1.34% rise, reflecting the 15% readjustment in the tariffs in Belo Horizonte, at the end of December. 
The General Price Index – Domestic Supply (IGP-DI) presented a 0.19% variation in January, practically repeating the December result, of 0.18%. The biggest decline of the Wholesale Price Index (IPA-DI), from 0.09% in December to –0.13% in January, was practically offset by the acceleration in the increase in the Consumer Price Index (IPC-Br), of 0.79% compared to 0.7% in December. At wholesale level the continuous fall in industrial prices (-0.32%) should be pointed out, while the prices of agricultural products increased by 0.37%, compared to 0.48% in the previous month. Regarding consumer prices, the IPC-Br reflected the seasonal effect of the expenditure with education, not yet reflected by the IPCA due to the differences in the survey methodology of both indices. 
In February, the IPCA will also be pressured by the increase in the prices of medicines, in addition to the pressures from the readjustment in school payment installments and materials. However, a deceleration in the index is expected, considering the fall in the clothing prices and the continuity of the absorption of the decline in gasoline prices. This trend may be accelerated with the expected fall in food prices, already registered by the wholesale price indices, as shown in the partial results of the Market General Price Index (IGP-M). 
The yield curve showed only slight movement since the last Copom meeting. The decision to keep the Over-Selic rate target unchanged reverted the negative slope of part of the yield curve, with the spread between the 3-month interest rate and the Selic rate changing to 11 b.p. on January 24th, from –9 b.p. on January 18th. Later, the announcement of inflation indices, the smooth reopening of Argentina’s market, and the expectation of a reduction in the Selic rate in the first quarter caused the reduction of that spread to –25 b.p. on February 18th. Within this period, the spread between the 1-year interest rate and Over-Selic rate also narrowed, moving to 47 b.p. from 102 b.p.. 
Continuing with the strategy of partially smoothening the redemptions of exchange rate indexed securities in 2002, Central Bank carried out, on January 24th, buy-back auctions of NBCE with redemptions between February and April 2002, simultaneously with selling auctions of National Treasury’s NTN-D, amounting to R$ 2.3 billion. There was higher demand for shortest-tenure securities (2-3 years) than in the previous operation, when securities of up to 6-year maturities were offered. The NTN-D premiums presented an upward trend during the period. 
Since January 29th, the National Treasury offered LTN on four occasions. At the first two events, securities of 7 and 14 months tenures were offered. Due to a reduction in the demand for longest-tenure securities, the offers of these securities were interrupted. The resulting financial volume of the placements reached R$ 8.3 billion, of which 92% referred to the shortest-tenure securities. 
On February 19th, the Treasury returned to offer LFT, which had not occurred since October 2001. Due to reduced demand, only 538 thousand securities were auctioned out, of a total 1 million offered. The two year tenure securities were placed with a 0.35% average discount, resulting in a value of R$ 0.7 billion. 
Considering the financial settlements occurred between January 23rd and February 19th, there was a monetary expansionist impact of R$ 3.0 billion, resulting from net redemptions of LTN (R$ 0.9 billion), of LFT (R$ 0.8 billion), and of intermediate interest payments on exchange rate indexed securities (R$ 1.3 billion). 
During the 18 working day period, the Central Bank intervened thirteen times in the open market, aiming at administering the very short-term interest rate. During all the interventions, the Central Bank provided liquidity to the market at a hurdle yield of 19.05% p.a., with an average volume of R$ 8.9 billion. 
The domestic federal securitized debt increased by R$ 11 billion in January. The 4.2% exchange variation generated an R$ 7.5 billion impact thus representing the main reason for the increase. 
Identified shocks and their impact were reassessed in light of newly available information. The scenario considered in the simulations considers the followings hypotheses: 
1 The inflation rate in January 2002, measured by the IPCA, was 0.52%, lower than the 0.65% observed in December 2001 , 
2 The projections for consumer prices of gasoline, diesel oil and bottled gas for 2002 and 2003 were made based on the price surveys of the National Petroleum Agency (ANP), which indicate a significant price reduction in the period since the market liberalization on January 1st until February 9th. After March, the projections reflect the price behavior in the futures market of Brent type petroleum of the International Petroleum Exchange (IPE), and of propane gas, of the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) , 
3 Some items included in the group of prices administered by contracts had their prices liberalized recently, such as fuel and bottled gas. The behavior of those prices, although determined by demand and supply conditions, can be projected more accurately with the monitoring of their respective cost structures. Therefore, the wider set of prices administered by contracts also includes the monitored prices and will be referred to as such. The definition of items incorporated in that group, weighing 30.5% of the IPCA, was maintained. For this set of prices, the readjustments are projected at 5.7% in 2002 and 3.8% in 2003. In the January meeting, the readjustments were projected at 5.4% in 2002 and 3.4% in 2003. Nonetheless, this 0.3 percentage point increase in the 2002 inflation projection of prices administered by contracts was basically concentrated in January, so that there was no significant alteration in the inflation forecast for the rest of the year. 
4 The projections for the readjustment of electricity prices in 2002 and 2003 are 19.3% and 14.0%. These adjustments incorporate the non-recurrent energy price increases which have already occurred this year and the 4% forecast for next year , 
5. The hypotheses of the previous meeting regarding the behavior of the slope of the domestic yield curve measured as the difference between the 180-day term DI rate and the 1-day Selic rate was maintained. The average slope of the domestic yield curve rises gradually to above 100 b.p. at the end of 2002 , 
6 The trend for the fed funds rate, projected based on the maturity of future contracts, was altered to reflect an average rate of 1.75% in the first quarter of 2002, which rises to 2.6% in the fourth quarter of 2002 , 
7 For the sovereign risk premium, a stable trend is forecast, using Global 04 Bond, at the level of 650 b.p. 
The core inflation of the IPCA, calculated under the symmetric trimmed-mean method, declined significantly in January to 0.52% from 0.77% in December. Accumulated in 12 months, the core index increased by 7.58%. The core inflation of the IPC-BR, calculated under symmetric trimmed-mean method, rose slightly from 0.71% in December to 0.73% in January. Accumulated over 12 months, that core index increased by 7.40%. The core inflation calculated with the exclusion of administered prices - considering the wide set weighting 30.5% of the IPCA in January - and of household food prices increased by 0.50% in January, with accumulated variation of 5.61% in 12 months. 
The IPCA increased by 7.62% in the last 12 months, reflecting a 4.6% contribution from free prices and 3.02% from monitored prices and prices administered by contracts. In 2002 and 2003, the monitored prices and prices administered by contracts are expected to increase by 5.7%, and 3.8%, with a direct contribution of 1.7 and 1.2 percentage points. 
Regarding fiscal policy, it has been assumed that the primary surplus target for the consolidated public sector stated in the Government Economic Program will be achieved. The remaining assumptions made in the previous meeting were maintained. 
Simulations exercises with several specifications of the structural model have led to the conclusion that the maintenance of interest rate at the current level of 19.0% p.a. and of the exchange rate at the same plateau as of the eve of Copom meeting would result in inflation around 4% for 2002. For 2003, the inflation projected by the structural model based on the hypotheses of maintenance of interest rate and of the exchange rate constant at the current level is below the center target of 3.25%. 
Inflation measured by the IPCA, after reaching 0.83% in October, has been continuously declining in the last 3 months, reaching 0.52% in January. The core inflation, measured by the trimmed average method, also declined in January, to 0.52%. The latter should be a sustainable trend as there is a reversion of the negative effects represented by the increases in monitored prices and prices administered by contracts, adverse weather factors and pressures for the recomposition of profit margins. These effects have been responsible for the slower than expected downward trajectory of the inflation. 
Indeed, in spite of the significant reduction in gasoline prices at the beginning of the year - gasoline registered a decline of 9.9% in the monthly IPCA and 14.4% up to February 9th, as surveyed by the National Agency of Petroleum - the inflation of monitored prices and prices administered by contracts did not recede as much as expected, due to the readjustments in other monitored prices and prices administered by contracts. Influencing the projections were bottled gas, which increased by 17.9% with the end of subsidies, and other items, with a small weight in the index. For instance, the 15% increase in the urban transportation prices in Belo Horizonte, the 23.0% increase in the real estate tax in São Paulo and of 10.4% in Porto Alegre. 
Pressure for recomposing profit margins (and the exchange rate pass-through) may decline due to some important factors. Firstly, due to the moderate expansion of credit, whose growth was low in 
the last few months. Secondly, the increase in investments observed in the past years, particularly in 2001, resulted in an increase of the productive capacity of the economy. This trend, associated with the existence of idle capacity in industry - the utilization of capacity in the industry reached 79.5% in January 2002 according to FGV's index and 78.6% in December 2001 according to CNI's index, both levels lower than the observed in 2001 - and to the absence of demand pressures coming from the real wage mass, indicate that the economy may expand without additional pressures on inflation. Besides, the end of the electricity rationing will increase the potential for output growth. Finally, inflation expectations surveyed by the Investor Relations Group (GCI) of Banco Central do Brasil are practically stable at 4.8% for 2002 and 4.0% for 2003. 
The external scenario has improved but requires some attention. There is a chance that the U.S. economy recovery will already begin in the first half of 2002. However, the outcome of the Argentine crisis and the evolution of the domestic situation of other Latin-American countries merit monitoring. The moderate fluctuations in the exchange rate and the stability in Brazil's risk indicate that the effect of the uncertainties in the international scenario are not worsening. 
The management of the inflation target system requires an effort from Copom to understand and quantify the several inflationary shocks so as to adequately calibrate monetary policy. Central Bank forecasts point to an inflation rate of 4% in 2002, including the primary effect of the shock coming from monitored prices and prices administered by contracts and from the inertia inherited from 2001, as described in the Open Letter to the Minister of Finance, of January 16th. The primary effect of the shocks from monitored prices and prices administered by contracts on the IPCA in 2002 - which is the value that exceeds the inflation target, after deducting the impacts of the exchange rate pass-through and the inertia from the monitored prices and prices administered by contracts- is estimated at up to 0.5p.p. Therefore, the deviation between projected inflation and the target center for 2002 is approximately equivalent to the contribution of the primary shock of monitored prices and prices administered by contracts. This deviation should not be necessarily corrected by the monetary policy inasmuch as monetary policy should be oriented towards eliminating only the second-round effect of the supply shocks on inflation, preserving the initial alignment of relative prices. 
Besides, due to the magnitude of the supply shocks occurred in 2001, the Copom understands that the appropriate time period for eliminating the inherited inertia may be extended beyond the calendar year. One estimates that the inflationary inertia resulting from the part of the inflation that exceeded the inflation target in 2001 should contribute with additional 0.7 p.p. to the IPCA in 2002. Part of this inertia will be eliminated in 2003. 
From the last two paragraphs, and given the available information, one concludes that monetary policy should target an inflation rate between 4.0% and 4.5%, within the target range for 2002. As Copom's projection is close to the lower limit of this range, monetary policy, at a first glance, could be eased. 
Such treatment given to the supply shocks is based on the view that, after the direct effects of the shocks and suppressed their secondary effects, inflation would return to the desired trend. Examining the projection for inflation for beyond the current year may test the consistency of this understanding. In this respect, some countries manage supply shocks examining the projection of inflation 18 to 24 months ahead and adjusting the monetary policy so that the projected inflation converges to the target in that time horizon. In the Brazilian case, the below the central target projection for inflation in 2003 reinforces the recommendation that, as this scenario confirms itself, the monetary policy could be eased. 
As the monetary policy operates with lags, its decisions should consider not only the past evolution of the relevant variables, but essentially their future behavior. Copom's projection of future inflation embodies a higher or lower degree of imprecision depending on the observed economic scenario. In this respect, part of the members of the Copom interpreted the domestic and external scenarios, including the recent fall in inflation, as sufficient evidence to confirm the projection of decrease in inflation towards its targets. Other members, however, considered that these signs are still preliminary and that further consolidation of the economic scenario is still necessary, which may occur in the near future.
"
01/04/2002;69;Arminio Fraga;"Recent results of the indicators of economic activity have confirmed the expectations of a gradual  recovery, outlined at the end of 2001. Industrial production, which, last October, was very  depressed reaching its lowest level since March 2000, has shown steady recovery since then. At the  beginning of this year industrial production remains below the level registered in the same period of  the last year. In the retail segment, the monthly results, in spite of showing a general trend of  recovery, have fluctuated between periods of expansion and contraction. This recent difference in  the pace of growth between industry and commerce suggests a movement of inventory recomposition,  which should reflect favorably on the forecasts for the coming months, both from a  consumer and business perspective, as recently surveyed.  
For the recent behavior of retail commerce in the metropolitan regions, one should take into account  that it is conditioned to the growth of the real wage mass, not perceptible in the last set of results,        and to the still modest improvement of credit conditions. Nevertheless, consumption outside the  metropolitan regions tends to be stimulated by the income expansion generated from the  agricultural sector, especially at this time of the year.
Preliminary figures released by the São Paulo State’s Federation of Commerce (Fecomércio)  regarding retail commerce in the metropolitan region of São Paulo showed a 1.5% decrease in real  turnover in February, compared to a 1.4% increase in the previous month (seasonally adjusted data).  Still in February, according to the São Paulo Trade Association (ACSP), there was a 2.1% rise in  enquiries to the Credit Protection Service (SPC), a 1.9% decrease of enquiries to the Telecheque,  and an increase in default levels, 8.2%, compared to 5.4% in January. 
The Index of Consumer Intentions (IIC), also surveyed by the Fecomércio, registered an increase in  March, showing that consumers are recovering their confidence in the economy, but are still  cautious, as the level of 98.3 registered by the indicator in March, compared to 97.2 in February, is  still below the line of optimism on the scale, that varies between 0 and 200. In March, there was a  significant improvement in the component that measures the current intentions, a 3.9% increase,  mainly as a result of less concern with the international scenario, while the component related to the  future intentions declined by 0.44%. 
In relation to the industrial sector, there was a 1.3% increase in production, in January, as released  by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). It was the third positive monthly  result, what confirms the prospect of recovery evident in the last surveys regarding the expectations  of business carried out by the National Confederation of Industry (CNI) and by the Getúlio Vargas  Foundation (FGV).  
Considering the analysis by categories of use and their performance after October, when the sector  recovery began, one can identify a stronger increase in the production of durable goods, which has  led the recovery of industrial activity. It should be highlighted, however, that in spite of the  expansion of the production of durable goods in the last months, the result for January was negative,  indicating that other factors related to the demand, such as the wage mass and the credit conditions,  are also important to sustain the performance of this segment. 
The indicators of activity in the primary sector were also favorable in the beginning of the year.  According to a survey carried out by the IBGE, in February, national grain production should reach  97.5 million tons in 2002. According to the Institute, this volume tends to be higher in the next  Systematic Survey of Agricultural Production, to be carried out in March, considering the initial  results of the second corn harvest, that show a stronger than expected increase in production. It  should be noted furthermore that the same survey forecasts an expansion in the production of items  of great importance in the basic consumption basket, such as rice and beans, and in the exports,  such as soybeans. 
In the labor market, the formal employment index was 0.2% higher in January than in December,  and 2.7% higher than in January 2001, according to the Ministry of Labor and Employment  (seasonally adjusted data by Depec). The average open unemployment rate measured by the IBGE  in the six main metropolitan regions reached 6.83% in January, compared to 5.6% in December and  5.7% in January 2001. This result was due to the 0.4% decline in the number of employed people in  January and to an expansion by 23.2% in the number of people searching for jobs, which  contributed to the 0.9% increase in the Economically Active Population (PEA). These results show  that the perception of recovery of the economic activity is motivating the search for job places by  unemployed people previously discouraged to do so.  
In the financial system, the behavior of the balance of credit operations has been stable, revealing  the existence of factors that restrict the recovery of its growth. Amongst the restricting factors, it is  worth pointing out the relatively high level of lending rates and banking spreads, which to a large  extent continue to be set by the default risk. In addition, the evolution of the income level and the  real wage mass have contributed to the cooling off of the demand for new loans, observed since the  second quarter of 2000 for both consumption and investment. 
In February, the balance of credit operations contracted by the banking system remained stable in  relation to the previous month, reaching R$334.4 billion. The operations with freely allocated  resources, represented 59% of the total and registered a moderate increase of 0.2%, due to the 0.6%  growth in the credit volume assigned to private individuals, whilst the balance of transactions with  corporations remained unchanged. The stability observed in the stock of banking credit in February  resulted, partly, from seasonal movements. On the one hand, the demand from corporations  declined in the first two months of the year, as a result of the inflow of resources from transactions        made at the end of the previous year, plus the lower level of activity. On the other hand, there was a  moderate growth in the stock of credit contracted by households, resulting mainly from the higher  demand for revolving credit, considering the usual concentration of commitments in the period,  such as taxes and schooling expenses.  
Regarding the external transactions of the Brazilian economy, the trade balance registered a  US$259 million surplus in February, totaling a US$434 million positive balance in the first two  months of the year, compared to a US$401 million deficit in the same period of 2001. Considering  daily average values, exports declined by 11.5% and imports by 19.8%, in the same period of  comparison. Regarding imports, all categories of products showed decline, even in relation to the  first two months of 2001, in spite of the recovery of domestic activity, indicating import substitution  by domestic production. The decline in the imports of fuels and lubricants also reflects their price  reduction.  
Besides the 67.1% drop in sales to Argentina, exports to other important markets such as Germany,  Belgium, Italy and Japan also declined significantly, reflecting the deceleration of the European  economies and the recession in Japan. Sales to the United States remained stable in comparison to  the first two months of 2001, in spite of the difference in the momentum of growth in those periods,  showing that Brazilian products have potential to increase their share in that competitive market. In  the case of Mexico, with the deceleration of its economy, the growth in Brazilian exports is  reflecting new trade agreements, particularly related to the automotive sector. 
Up to March 17th, the trade balance registered a US$ 231 million surplus, as a consequence of the  continued drop in imports and the beginning of the export recovery, mainly as a result of the  expansion in the sale of basic products.  
The recent trend of the economic indicators, as a whole, shows that the recovery of the activity  level, which started at the end of 2001, has steadily and consistently continued in the first months of  the year. The improvement in the expectations, the inventory re-composition and the additional  demand resulting from the movement of import substitution are important factors in that process. It  is worth highlighting once again, however, that the realization of this scenario is still conditioned,  among other factors, to the recovery of earnings and the improvement of financing conditions, with  the consequent expansion in the credit volume. In regard to the supply side, the idleness in the  industrial plants allows the growth of the activity level currently observed without pressures on        prices. The overcoming of the energy crisis and the end of the rationing, will also contribute to  normalize the productive activity, mainly in the electricity-intensive sectors.  
The U.S. economy has been presenting signs of recovery, although the uncertainty in relation to its  intensity still persists. The first indicators of the year show that the retraction expected by the  market did not materialize, as production has been stimulated mainly by domestic demand. Orders  for manufactured goods increased by 1.6% in January, following the 0.7% increase in December.  The retail sales increased by 0.2% in February, compared to January, and the wholesale sales rose  by 1.2% in January, compared to December, considering seasonally adjusted series. 
The U.S. GDP increased by 1.4% in the 4th quarter of 2001, compared to the previous quarter, while  the industrial production rose by 0.4% in February, compared to the 0.2% revised growth in  January. This growth trend has been followed by the decline in the unemployment rate, to 5.5% in  February from 5.8% in December 2001, due mainly to the creation of 66 thousand new job  positions, the first rise in occupation in the last seven months. The increase of 5.2% in the  productivity of the non-agricultural sector in the 4th quarter should also be pointed out, followed by  the reduction by 2.67% in the unit labor cost, that has been decreasing for four quarters
The producer price index showed a –1.8% variation in 2001, while its core, which excludes  variations in food and energy prices, increased by 0.7%. In February, the index rose by 0.2%, a  seasonally adjusted monthly variation, while its core did not change. The consumer price index  increased by 1.6% and its core increased by 2.7% in 2001. 
The activity indicators surveyed by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM, ex NAPM) ratified  that the country’s economy is recovering. The national index of industrial activity, reached 54.7 in  February, compared to 49.9 in the previous month, while the service index (BAI) rose to 58.7 from  49.6, both above 50, showing that the entrepreneurs believe in economic recovery. Showing a  similar trend, the index of the Michigan University, which measures consumer confidence, rose to  95 in March, compared to 90.7 in February.  
In Japan, the recession intensified in the last quarter of 2001. The GDP declined by 2.2% in the 4th        quarter, compared to the previous quarter. The annualized fall reached 4.5% - the GDP declined for  three consecutive quarters for the first time in almost a decade. Industrial production continued to  show a declining trend, while the trade balance, which had been in decline since July 2001,  registered a slight improvement, reflecting the performance of the U.S. and some Eastern Asian  countries.  
In the Euro area, the consolidated data remains patchy. On the contrary of the United States,  consumer expenditure has not contributed to growth recovery. The recovery of the retail sales,  verified in November, did not repeat itself in December, with a decline of 0.6% (seasonally adjusted  monthly variation). The GDP declined by 0.3% in the 4th quarter, compared to the previous quarter,  though growing by 1.5% in the year, following the 3.3% growth in 2000. However, the main  economies in the region – Germany, France and Italy – whose indicators have a smaller lag than the  ones in the Euro area as a whole, presented signs of recovery in activity level, although at a slower  pace and lower intensity than in the United States.  
The signs of a possible recovery in the developed countries improve perspectives for the emerging  economies. The financial crises seem to be solved, as in the case of Turkey, or with an even more  limited potential of contagion, in the case of Argentina.
The main price indices showed a decline in inflation in February. The Consumer Price Index –  Extended (IPCA) decelerated for the fourth consecutive month, with a 0.36% variation in February,  compared to 0.52% in the previous month. The deceleration of the index resulted from the smaller  increase in food prices, 0.2%, compared to 0.85% in January, due to the beginning of the  commercialization of the new harvest and favorable climatic conditions. The rise in prices of nonfood  products remained practically stable in February, with a 0.41% variation, compared to 0.42%  in January.  
Amongst the main factors that influenced the IPCA result, one may highlight the decline in prices  of rice and beans, 12.1% and 2.1%, respectively, and the decline in gasoline price, 5.12%. Gasoline  price variation was responsible for the highest negative contribution in the month, 0.2-percentage  point. Prices of clothing declined by 0.67%, due to sales, compared to the 0.55% rise in January.
Among the items that showed price increase, attention must be drawn to the school fees, which  presented a 5.51% variation in the month, being responsible for the highest contribution to the  IPCA in February, 0.22- percentage point. Pharmaceutical products rose by 2.09%, in consequence  of the 5.83% average readjustment conceded at the end of January. The urban transport tariffs  increased by 0.83%, mirroring rises in Porto Alegre and Curitiba. Electricity increased by 0.21%,  reflecting the residue of the increase in January, when the contractual readjustment occurred in Rio  de Janeiro. 
The General Price Index – Domestic Supply (IGP-DI) varied 0.18% in February, compared to  0.19% in January. Despite the deceleration observed in the consumer prices component, 0.14%  compared to 0.79% in January, basically for the same reasons already mentioned in the IPCA  evolution, the general index remained practically stable, due to the rise registered by the Wholesale  Price Index (IPA), 0.14%, compared to a decline of 0.13% in January. The National Index of Civil  Construction (INCC) also held back the IPC deceleration, showing a 0.58% variation compared to  0.36% in January, due mainly to the effect of increase in cost of labor.  
the wholesale market, agricultural prices declined by 0.44% in the month, due mainly to the  decline in cereals and grains (beans and rice) and Agriculture for export (soybean), in addition to  the deceleration of the rise in prices of the group livestock and its products. Prices of industrial  products increased by 0.36%, following consecutive drops of 0.32% in December and January,  particularly pressured by the rise in prices of products of chemical, mechanical and mining  industries, rubber, tobacco, pharmaceutical products and textiles, clothing and shoes. 
It must be pointed out that the deceleration observed in the consumer price indices reflects  favorable aspects prevailing in the current scenario – absence of pressures due to the exchange rate  variations, increase of food supply, due both to the harvest season and to the adequate climatic  conditions, and level of idleness of installed capacity in industry. In addition, it must be considered,  over a larger time horizon, the prospect of productivity gains in all sectors of the economy, as a  consequence of the increase in investment observed in 2000 and 2001.  
Besides those aspects, it must be highlighted that, the fuel price readjustments occurred on March  2nd and 16th, will cause a temporary interruption of the inflation deceleration process. The impact of  those increases, amongst other factors, will overlap the effects of the cooling off of agricultural        prices and of the exhaustion of the typical pressures of the beginning of the year, as the ones  coming from the school fee readjustments and from the increase in prices of fresh food.  
After the Copom decision in February, the yield curve, which already projected a reduction of the  Over-Selic rate target, showed a downward shift for all maturities, maintaining the negative slope  for the short run. In the following weeks the falling trend became stronger due to the improvement  in the expectations related to the economic and political scenarios. On March 20th, the yield curve  indicated a reduction for the Over-Selic rate target for this Copom meeting, with the spread between  the 1-month interest rate and Over-Selic rate falling to –59 b.p., on March 20th, from –7 b.p., on  February 21st. For 1-year term, the spread fell to –75 b.p. from 10 b.p.  
For the rollover of NBCEs totaling R$3.9 billion, maturing on March 14th, nine auctions were  carried out with terms of 1, 2, 3 and 6 years. In regard to the rollover of the securities maturing on  February 21st, the average tenure of the issuances increased to 27 from 14 months. The auctions also  showed a reduction in the demanded premiums in relation to the CDI curve.  
The National Treasury has also promoted the lengthening of the tenure of fixed-rate securities.  Between February 21st and March 19th, LTNs were offered on five occasions: in the usual auctions  on Tuesdays, securities of 8- and 13-month tenures were offered, on March 15th, a firm offer  auction was carried out with 22-month tenure securities. The average rates of 8-month securities fell  to 18.29% from 19.01%, and of 13-month securities, to 18.65% from 19.87%. The 22-month tenure  securities were totally placed at an average rate of 20.07%. The overall financial volume of the  placements reached R$9.1 billion, of which 73% referred to the 8-month tenure securities.  
Considering the financial settlements that occurred between February 20th and March 19th, there  was a monetary expansionist impact of R$4.0 billion, resulting from net redemptions of LFT  (R$11.7 billion) and intermediate interest payment on exchange rate indexed securities (R$1.0  billion), partially offset by the net placement of LTN (R$8.7 billion).  
During a period of 19 working days, the Central Bank intervened thirteen times in the open market,  aiming at administering the very short-term interest rate. During all the interventions, the Central        Bank provided liquidity to the market at a hurdle yield of 18.80%, with an average volume of R$6.7  billion.  
As in January, the overall daily average traded volume in the secondary market dropped, in  February, to R$6.0 billion, from R$7.0 billion. This drop was due mainly to the 29% reduction in  the daily average turnover of LTN, to R$2.4 billion from R$3.4 billion.  
The appreciation of the Real in February was the main factor responsible for the R$3.5 billion  decrease in the domestic federal securitized debt and for the reduction to 28.7%, from 29.4%, in the  relative share of the exchange rate linked debt. 
The identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed in light of newly available information. The  scenario considered in the simulations assumes the following hypotheses: 
1. February inflation variation, measured by the IPCA, fell to 0.36% compared to 0.52% in  January,  
2. Regarding the liberalization of the prices of petroleum and their by-products, the forecast  for their prices adopted the following parameters: the behavior of the exchange rate, the  spot price of the gasoline in the United States (Energy Information Administration) and  the price behavior of Brent type petroleum in the futures market of the International  Petroleum Exchange (IPE), for the readjustments of the gasoline and diesel oil, the spot  price of propane gas in the United States (Energy Information Administration) and the  price behavior of propane gas in the futures market of the New York Mercantile  Exchange (NYMEX), for the readjustments of bottled gas. Considering the average price  of the barrel of crude oil around US$23.3 until the end of this year and the maintenance  of the Real on the current level, gasoline prices for the consumer should increase 8.2%  until the end of this year. This increase already encompasses the pass-through of the last  readjustments of 2.2% and 9.4% at refinery, defined by Petrobrás. For 2002, the forecast  for gasoline prices for consumer presents a 7.5% decline, due to the fall occurred in  January and February. The elimination of the subsidies for the bottled gas and the        increase in the future curve of propane gas will result in an increase in bottled gas prices  of over 20% in 2002, of which 16.3% has already occurred in the first two months of  2002,  
3. Regarding the set of prices administered by contracts and monitored prices, weighting  30.5% in the IPCA of February, the expected readjustments are 6.8% for 2002 and 4.5%  for 2003, with direct contribution of 2.1 p.p. and 1.4 p.p. for the IPCA. In the February  meeting, the expected readjustments were 5.7% and 3.8%, respectively. This 1.1 p.p.  increase in the inflation forecast for 2002 reflects the increases already announced for  gasoline prices. In March, the forecast for the readjustment of electricity tariffs for 2002  declined to 16.6% from 19.3% forecast in February. Regarding 2003, the forecast for the  readjustment of electricity declined to 13.0% from 14.0% in February. These increases  are concentrated between April and July, 
4. The projection for the slope of the domestic yield curve for the next eight quarters,  measured as the difference between the 180-day term DI rate and the 1-day Selic rate, is  now based on a regression model that has as explicative variables: i) the Selic rate and ii)  the projection of 180-days forward implied in the slope of the term interest rate, lagged  by two quarters. This model indicates a trajectory beginning from the current plateau  (around –0.18 p.p.), decreasing to a minimum of -0.7 p.p. until the third quarter,  gradually increasing until becoming null at the end of 2003.  
5. The trajectory of US Fed Funds rate, based on the maturity of futures contracts, was  changed to reflect an average rate of 1.75% in the first quarter of 2002, increasing to  3.2% in the last quarter of 2002, stabilizing thereafter, 
6. Regarding the sovereign risk premium, using Brazil’s Global 04, a decline is forecasted  for the second quarter of 2002 to the level observed in the end of March 2002 (550 b.p.),  from the average 630 b.p. in the first quarter of 2002, stabilizing thereafter.  
The core inflation of the IPCA, calculated under the symmetric trimmed-mean method, increased to  0.54% in February from 0.52% in January. In the last 12 months, this core recorded a 7.58%  variation. The core inflation of the IPC-BR, calculated under the symmetric trimmed-mean method,        recorded a high fall to 0.44% in February from 0.73% in January. This core accumulated a 7.49%  variation in the last 12 months. The core inflation calculated by excluding the prices administered  by contracts (considering the wide set of these items weighting 30.5% of the IPCA in January) and  of household food prices registered a 0.85% variation in February, accumulating 5.86% in 12  months. 
The IPCA variation accumulated in 12 months reached 7.51%, a figure lower than that observed in  January (7.62%) and in December of 2001 (7.67%). The free prices and the prices administered by  contracts and monitored prices contributed with 4.75 p.p. and 2.76 p.p. to inflation, respectively.  The inflation expectations as surveyed by the Investor Relations Group (GCI) of the Central Bank  recorded a slight increase to 4.99% in 2002 and remaining stable at 4.00% in 2003.  
Regarding fiscal policy, the hypothesis of achieving the primary surplus targets for the consolidated  public sector, as stated in the Economic Program of the Government, was maintained, as well as the  remaining assumptions established in the previous meeting.  
The simulation exercises with several specifications of the structural model permitted a conclusion  that the maintenance of the basic interest rate at 18.75% p.a. and the exchange rate at the same  plateau as on the eve of the Copom meeting, point to an inflation below 4.5% in 2002 and below  3.0% in 2003
The external scenario has improved since the February Copom meeting. There are clear signs of US  economic recovery from the GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2001, the drop in the  unemployment rate in January and in February and the rise in the orders to the industry. Moreover,  in the last months, since the Argentinean peso depreciation, Argentine crisis contagion on the  Brazilian economy has been limited.  
An improved international scenario has led to a reduction in the risk premium. Risk premium  measured by EMBI-Brazil fell by 80 bp between February and March meetings. Compared to the  average in the last quarter of 2001, this drop exceeded 300 bp. This shift favors balance of payment  financing. The trade balance keeps presenting increasing surpluses, accumulating US$3.5 billion in        the 12 months ended in February. Current account deficit, accumulated over 12 months, has been  declining continuously since August 2001, reaching US$22.1 billion in January 2002. This  improvement is mirrored by the 3.3% real appreciation since the last Copom meeting and by the  capital flows stability.  
The evolution of the economic activity level shows that economy has been growing, although at a  moderate rate. Industrial production has been growing since October 2001, reaching in January  2002 its highest level for the last nine months. The use of installed capacity in industry grew by  2.3% as compared to December (CNI seasonally adjusted data). The end of the energy rationing  may give room to an expansion in the aggregate supply, contributing to economic recovery. On the  other hand, aggregate demand reacts to better consumer and entrepreneur confidence indices and to  market interest rates reduction. Since October 2001 interest rate fall implicit in the 1-year DI-Pre  swaps, dropped by 7 p.p.  
However, evolution of credit operations and real wage mass may limit the speed of economic  recovery and inhibit inflationary pressure that could arise from the demand increase or the profit  margins re-composition. Economic uncertainties and a high level of payments in arrears have  refrained credit expansion in the last months. The credit operations outstanding to the private sector  have been relatively stable in the last months. As compared to January 2001, total loans to the  private sector grew by 5.7% in nominal terms, lower than inflation in the period. Real wage mass  declined for the first three quarters of 2001 and remained practically stable between November and  December (seasonally adjusted data).  
Inflation measured by IPCA declined continuously to 0.36% in February from 0.83% in October.  Forecasts prepared through the various specifications of the structural model point to inflation  slightly below 4.5% in 2002 and 3.0% in 2003. Since last Copom meeting, the forecast for IPCA in  2002 increased 0.4 p.p. due to the revision of gasoline prices, bottled gas (due to the rise in propane  prices in the future markets), urban transport (by 15.8% in Porto Alegre and by 8% in Curitiba) and  water and sewage tariff, in this order. Forecast for monitored prices and prices administered by  contracts grew to 6.8% from 5.7%. These high readjustments in monitored prices and prices  administered by contracts represent new primary shocks in the economy, and put pressure on free  prices (secondary effect), causing inflation convergence to its target to be slower and costly.  
The increase in the forecasts for the prices administered by contracts increased the estimate for the  primary effect of the shock coming from these prices – which is the value that exceeds inflation  target, after deducting the impacts of the exchange rate pass-through and the inertia from these  prices – from up to 0.5 p.p. to up to 0.9 p.p. Since most of this rise is due to gasoline prices  increase, naturally volatile, it is premature to consider the exact impact of this shock on the inflation  range Copom will target.  
The prospects for free prices are favorable and point to an inflation fall. The following factors  acting favorably: i) exchange rate appreciated as compared to the average of the last quarter, and is  stable, ii) energy rationing ended, iii) labor market and idle capacity do not put pressure on prices,  iv) inflationary inertia inherited from 2001 tend to vanish, and v) an expected record harvest in  2002 has the effect of reducing food prices. Notwithstanding free inflation has reached 1.2% in the  first two months of 2002, due to the mentioned factors, Copom maintains the projection of rises for  free prices at 3.4% for 2002 and 2.1% for 2003.  
Summarizing, positive external scenario, the trend of decline in the inflation and the projections for  the IPCA in 2002 and 2003 justify a trajectory of declining interest rates. However, the secondary  effect of the rises in monitored prices and prices administered by contracts on the inflation and the  uncertainty prevailing on the speed of the fall of free prices recommend caution in the conduct of  monetary policy.
"
29/04/2002;70;Arminio Fraga;" The trend exhibited by the activity level indicators ratified the movement of gradual recovery which began in the last quarter of 2001. Regarding production, industrial performance registered the fourth positive result in February, while the projections for grain production in the current harvest turned out to be more favorable since the last survey. As regards demand, investment presents itself as the main component of the expansion, showing recovery of the indicators of civil construction and capital goods production, in the three-month period ending in February. Consumption indicators have evolved with relative stability in the firsts months of the year, yet with positive prospects due to the income generated by the agriculture and livestock sector, the decline in default levels, and the improvement in consumer expectations. As for the external sector, trade transactions have presented favorable balances, mainly as a result of the contraction in imports, which reflects, among others, the import substitution process. 
The real turnover of retail commerce in the metropolitan region of São Paulo showed a 0.2% decrease in March (seasonally adjusted data), according to preliminary figures released by the São Paulo State’s Federation of Commerce (Fecomércio). The result in the month reflected drops in the segments of durable and semi-durable consumer goods, partly offset by positive results in the remaining sectors, especially the sales of building materials. With that outcome, the retail commerce accumulated a 1.2% increase in the first quarter of 2002 compared to the previous one, in the seasonally adjusted data. However, in relation to the same period of past year, the retail sector registered a 6.2% decrease in the first three months, the major drops occurring in the segments of vehicle sales and building materials. On the same basis of comparison, the country-wide survey carried out by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) also registered a decline, although much slighter, of 1% in the first two months of the year. The IBGE also confirmed that the major decline occurred in the sector of vehicle sales. 
In accordance to São Paulo Trade Association (ACSP), the activity in the retail commerce should not show signs of recovery in March. The enquiries to the Credit Protection Service (SPC) presented a decrease of 6.1% in March in relation to February (seasonally adjusted data), while the enquiries to the Usecheque registered a less intense decline, of 0.9%. However, another indicator of this same institution was favorable. The number of consumers with credit rights legally revalidated registered new growth, which contributed to the drop of defaults in the retail commerce to 6% in March, from 8.2% in February, compared to 9.3% registered in March 2001. The default rate (ratio of number of checks returned due to insufficient funds and those cleared) reached 5.2% in March, showing stability in relation to February 2002 and March 2001. 
The Index of Consumer Intentions (IIC) released by Fecomércio, in spite the 6.9% drop registered in the current intentions, increased by 0.6% in April, thus reflecting an improvement in future consumption intentions, a component that represents 60% of the index and that showed a 5% increase. The National Index of Consumers Expectations (INEC) has also evolved favorably, reaching 96.3 in March from 94.54 in November. For the most part, the index components presented a favorable evolution, mainly the general and personal income expectations. On the other hand, the index related to the prospects for the year declined to 108.17 from 112.08. 
Industrial production rose by 0.3% in February (seasonally adjusted data), according to the IBGE. This result reflected mainly the steep growth of capital goods production, 5.3%, followed by the increase in the production of intermediate goods, 1.2%. In contrast, the production of consumer goods declined by 1.4%. Comparing February to the October index, when the industrial production resumed growth, a 4.8% growth was observed, with all categories of use in expansion. 
The production of capital goods increased by 0.5% in the first two months of the year, basically reflecting the expressive expansion of 14.7% in the production of electric power generating equipment. Also worth mentioning is the growth rates observed in the production of agricultural machinery (12.4%) and industrial commissioned built goods (16.4%), which indicates the expansion of the production capacity in the respective sectors. Another favorable indicator of the investment behavior is the recent monthly increase in the production of inputs for civil construction, after the 2.5% drop in 2001, which has contributed to increase the participation of the Gross Capital Formation in the GDP. 
The indicators of activity in the primary sector surveyed by the IBGE through its Systematic Survey of Agricultural Production were more favorable in February than the indicators released in the previous month. Total grain production will reach 99.1 million tons in 2002 (97.5 million tons in the previous survey), exceeding by 0.6% the total 2001 harvest. Production of beans will increase by 27.5%, a forecast that caused a 16.3% reduction in its prices in the first quarter of 2002, as measured by the IPCA. The Survey also registered an expansion of 10.5% in the production of soybeans and of 3.8% for rice. For the corn, a 10.4% drop is expected. 
The index of formal employment, based on data from the Ministry of Labor and Employment, grew in February, presenting a 0.4% variation considering the series adjusted for seasonal effects. On the other hand, the open unemployment rate assessed by the IBGE, based on a survey carried out in the six main metropolitan regions, reached 6.98% in February, from 6.83% in January. This result was due to the 0.33% growth in the Economically Active Population (PEA), surpassing the 0.12% rise of job offers. In addition, based on IBGE data, real average wage increased by 2.02% and real wage mass grew by 3.02% (seasonally adjusted data). The real wage mass of industry also evolved favorably in February, increasing by 0.6% in the processing industry in São Paulo, as informed by Fiesp, and by 0.33% according to the CNI survey. 
The credit operations continued to present a slight evolution in March. The stock of credit granted by the financial system reached R$335.5 billion, increasing by 0.4 % as compared to the previous month. Out of this total, R$197.2 billion referred to operations with free resources, which expanded by 0.6 % in the period, as a result of the 1.6% growth in the total balance of loans to households, while the stock of the operations with companies remained stable. 
Regarding concessions, the monthly expansion in the flow of operations by 5.7% and 7.3%, respectively with households and companies, was basically due to the higher number of working days in the period. The average borrowing from the banking system in the first quarter of this year, when compared with the same period of 2001, increased by 4.4% and 4.7% for households and companies, respectively, thus below the accumulated variation of price indices in the period. 
This performance is compatible with the modest growth observed in the economic activity level in the period, and indicates the cooling off in the demand for new resources by the industrial sector, while financial institutions have become more selective in their credit concessions, especially the ones granted to households. This restriction is expressed in the interest rates, whose composition is related to the increase in default levels in the credit operations, as a result of the fall in household's disposable income in the period. 
Regarding the external transactions of the Brazilian economy, a significant improvement was observed in the first quarter of 2002, with a drop in the current account deficit, which registered US$3.2 billion, more than entirely financed by the net inflow of foreign direct investments, of US$4.7 billion. 
The reduction in the current account deficit was due to an identical movement in the net expenses with services and revenues, to a deficit of U$4.6 billion in the first quarter of 2002, as compared to a U$6.4 billion deficit in the first quarter of 2001. Another reason was the reversion in the trade balance result, which showed a surplus of U$1.028 billion compared to a U$681 million deficit in the same period of the previous year. The trade balance result partially reflects the process of imports substitution, more evident since the last quarter of 2001, when the domestic economic activity resumed its recovery. The comparison of data from industry with imports illustrates this fact. Considering seasonally adjusted data, from October 2001 to February this year, the monthly industrial production grew by 3.1%, while imports of intermediate goods decreased by 2%. 
In summary, the recovery of economic activity initiated at the end of 2001 continues. In general, both demand and supply indicators show an upward trend, albeit gradual. The improvement in the expectations favors the recovery of inventories and investment flows. These factors, allied to the imports substitution process, tend to boost domestic production. The idle capacity in the industrial plants and the end of electricity rationing have allowed production to respond to these stimuli without further pressure on prices. Finally, in the labor market, employment and income indicators more clearly reflect the movement of recovery, albeit incipient. 
The world economy has performed better than expected by the market, combining increasing recovery in activity levels with low inflation rates. The United States seem to be leading this re-bound, as occurred in the deceleration observed last year. Amongst the developed countries, the exception is Japan, whose economy remains in recession. In spite of the growth resumption, risks still remain in the external scenario, the main one being the volatility of oil prices, due to the political instabilities in the Middle East and Venezuela. 
The final GDP growth estimate for the United States in the last quarter of 2001, according to seasonally adjusted and annualized data, was 1.7%, 1.5 p.p. above January’s first estimate. Contributing to this result was the expansion in consumer and government expenditures, of 6.1% and 10.2%, respectively. Gross private investments accentuated their contraction to –23.5% from –10.5% in the preceding quarter, accumulating six quarters of negative variation. 
Amongst demand indicators of the U.S. economy, retail sales increased by 1.8%, accumulated in the twelve months ending in March, from 1.3% in the previous month. Wholesale sales increased by 0.8% in February, after a 1.2% increase in January, with the quarterly moving average reached 0.2% and –1,1%, respectively. Factory orders continued with a negative accumulated variation over twelve months, 8.7% in February, although with positive results in the quarterly moving average, of 0.7%, indicating activity recovery. The beginning of new home construction varied by 8.6% in March, as measured by accumulated figures in the quarter, less volatile than the monthly indicator. Credit to consumers, on the seasonally adjusted series, registered a monthly increase of 5.2% in February, similar to the rate measured in the previous month.
In the United States, the industrial production in March presented the highest monthly expansion since May 2000, 0.7%, resulting in a 0.5pp increase in utilized capacity, to reach 75.4%. Inventory slowly declined by 0.1% in January and February. On the other hand, the unemployment rate resumed growth (5.7% in March from 5.5% in February), whilst the quarterly variation of the employment volume declined by 53 thousand positions in the non-farming sector. 
In spite of these indicators of recovery in the U.S. growth, stimulated by the fiscal expansion and by monetary easing, mainly via interest rates, the inflation indices remain on a favorable trajectory. In March, consumer prices increased by 0.3%, with the core inflation rising by 0.1%, resulting in yearly variations of 1.5% and 2.4%, respectively. As for producer prices, the core index increased by 0.1%, accumulating a 0.4% inflation in 12 months, and, although the inflation in the head index was 1%, the annual variation in March was negative by 1.4%. 
In relation to the expectations for the United States economy, the Institute for Supply Management (former-NAPM) indicators in March point to prospects for expansion (results above 50), both for the services sector and for the manufacturing sector (55.6 and 57.3, respectively). As regards consumers, the confidence survey of the Conference Board registered an increase of 15.2 points between February and March, to reach 110.2. 
In the Euro Area, recovery still seems more uncertain, although the statistics are released with a longer time lag. Retail sales grew by 0.7% in January, compared to the same month of 2001, after a 0.5% expansion in the previous month. The trade balance continued to present growing surpluses, reaching an equivalent of US$46.6 billion in the past 12 months, US$40 billion above the 12 months ending in January 2001. The industrial production remained stable in January, after varying by 0.4% in December last year, but its annual result was still negative (3.2%). The unemployment rate remained stable at 8.4% between November 2001 and February 2002. In February, both the harmonized consumer price and the producer's price indices increased by 0.1%, accumulating annual variations of 2.4% and -1.1%, respectively. 
The most positive issue in the economic scenario is the entrepreneurial expectations indicators of the main economies of the Euro Area. In Germany, the Overall Index of Business Expectations, measured by the Institute of Economic Research (IFO), increased by 3.3 points in March to reach 91.8, its highest level since April 2001. In France, the Industrial Trends Survey of the National Institute of Statistics and Economic Research (Insee) reached 94 points in March, compared to 93 in the previous month. In Italy, the index of the Institute of Economic Analysis and Research (Isae) accumulated a 5 points increase in 2002, reaching 94 points in March. 
The Consumer Price Index – Extended (IPCA) increased by 0.6% in March, interrupting the trend of declining rates observed in the last months. The index accumulated a 1.49% rise in the year and a 7.75% rise in the last twelve months. Among the factors which were responsible for the increase of the index variation in the month, the administered prices should be highlighted, due, mainly, to the readjustments in gasoline prices. Gasoline was the item that showed the highest individual contribution to the index in the period (0.15 percentage point). In addition to gasoline, the variations in the prices of electricity (0.09 percentage point), urban transport (0.03 percentage point), among others, led to a contribution of 0.29 of a percentage point from the prices administered by contracts in March. 
Considering the free prices, the readjustments in the price of medicine should be pointed out and the faster increases in prices in the food segment, which mainly reflected the increases in the prices of milk and milk-by-products, ready made meals and fresh food – despite the continuity of the decline in the prices of meat, rice and beans. 
The General Price Index – Domestic Supply (IGP-DI) varied by 0.11% in March, compared to 0.18% in February, accumulating a 0.48% increase in the year and a 9.14% increase in the last twelve months. The Wholesale Price Index (IPA-DI) has been relatively stable since the beginning of the year, mirroring the exchange rate evolution and the favorable agricultural harvest, amongst others. In March, the IPA declined by 0.11%, after the 0.14% increase in February. Despite the decline in wholesale prices, the Consumer Price Index (IPC-Br) increased by 0.42%, compared to 0.14% in the previous month due, basically, to the rise in costs with transport. The variation of the National Index of Civil Construction (INCC-DI) declined to 0.55% from 0.58%, with an increase in labor costs (to 0.75% from 0.69%) and a fall in materials and services (to 0.35% from 0.47%). 
For April the main impacts on price indices should come once again from prices administered by contracts, due to the readjustments of gasoline on March 16th and April 6th (9.39% and 10.08%, respectively, at the refinery), bottled gas, after April 1st (15% at the refinery), and electricity, as a consequence tariff increases in Belo Horizonte, Recife, Salvador, Porto Alegre and Fortaleza. 
It should be pointed out from the evolution of prices in February and March that the upward pressures resulted basically from supply shocks, related to the international market, as in the case of fuel, from seasonal factors, as in the case of the costs with education, or from climatic factors, as in the case of the several types of fresh food. Those shocks have not caused spill over to other prices in economy. Nevertheless, the major impact is still to be observed. The results of the price indices in April, as mentioned above, will incorporate, at a higher intensity, the effects of the fuel and electricity readjustments. 
After the last Copom decision to reduce the Over-Selic rate target by 25 b.p., the yield curve, which had indicated a reduction of approximately 50 b.p., shifted upwards for all maturities, maintaining a negative slope for the short run, however with a lower declivity. During the following weeks, the curve remained steady, showing a gradual reduction for the short run rates. On April 17th, the yield curve incorporated a reduction in the Over-Selic rate target by 25 b.p. The spread between the 1-month interest rate and Over-Selic rate fell to -24 b.p, on April 17th, from -3 b.p., on March 21st. For 1-year term, it increased to 2 b.p. from -28 b.p. 
In the period between March 21st and April 17th, the National Treasury and Banco Central do Brasil carried out nine auctions to rollover two redemptions of NBCEs, totaling R$ 8.7 billion. For the first rollover, two NTN-D auctions were carried out - at two and three year tenures - together with four auctions of exchange rate swaps conjugated to LFT primary offers - at a two year term. For the second rollover, only exchange rate swaps conjugated to LFT auctions were carried out, also at a two year term. As a result of applying the new mechanism (swaps), the demanded premiums over the CDI reduced. It should be stressed that Banco Central do Brasil decided not to rollover the final interest payments on the April 18th redemption, keeping with the integral rollover of the principal. 
The National Treasury offered 8 and 12 month-tenure LTNs on four occasions, totaling a financial volume of R$ 9.2 billion. As a result, the average tenure of the placements increased. The issuance of over 12-month tenure securities represented 41% of the overall financial volume, compared to 18% in the previous period. 
Considering the financial settlements which took place between March 20th and April 16th, there was a monetary expansionist impact of R$ 14.5 billion, resulting from high net redemptions of LFT. 
During a 19 working day period, Banco Central do Brasil intervened 16 times in the open market, aiming at administering the very short-term interest rate. In 3 interventions, Banco Central provided liquidity to the market at a hurdle yield of 18.55% p.a., with an average volume of R$ 2.9 billion. In 13 interventions, Banco Central withdrew liquidity at a yield of 18.40% p.a., (except once, on 4/17/2002, when the rate was of 18.38%), with a R$ 3.8 billion average volume. 
In March, the domestic federal securitized debt fell by R$5.3 billion, basically due to the net redemption of R$ 10.1 billion in securities. The securities indexed to the Over-Selic rate presented a R$ 16.8 billion net redemption, while the placements of fixed-rate securities reached R$ 8.7 billion, without any redemption in the period. The debt indexed to the exchange rate variation declined by R$ 1.7 billion, as a result of the 1.1% appreciation of the Real. 
The identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed in the light of newly available information. The scenario considered in the simulations assumes the following hypotheses: 
1. March inflation rate, measure by the IPCA, increased to 0.60% from 0.36% in February, 
2. With the liberalization of the prices of petroleum and its by-products, the forecasts for their prices assumed the following parameters: the behavior of the exchange rate for all its by-products, the spot and futures prices of gasoline in the United States for the gasoline readjustments, and the spot price of the propane gas in the United States as well as the futures prices negotiated in the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) for the readjustment of bottled gas. There was a change in the methodology that had been applied up to the last Copom meeting, which considered the future price of the Brent crude oil barrel as a parameter for the forecast of the price readjustments of oil by-products. According to the new source of data, the consumer price of gasoline should increase by 4.9% by the end of the year, already taking into account the 10.2% pass through in the refinery, implemented by Petrobrás on April 3rd. For 2002 as a whole, and due to the fall occurred in January and February, a 6.6% decline in consumer gasoline prices is forecasted. For the bottled gas, the elimination of the subsidies and the increase in the slope of future prices of propane gas should result in an increase close to 30% in 2002, of which 16% has already occurred in the first quarter. 
3. Regarding the set of prices administered by contracts and monitored, weighting 30.3% in the IPCA of March, the expected readjustments are of 7.2% for 2002 and 4.3% for 2003, with a direct contribution of 2.2 p.p. and 1.3 p.p. in the IPCA. At the March meeting, the expected readjustments for these prices were of 6.8% and a 4.5%, respectively. This 0.4 p.p. increase in the forecast for the 2002 inflation of these prices reflects the already announced increase in gasoline. The average increase in electricity tariffs is projected to be 15% for 2002, compared to the 16.6% estimated in March. It should be highlighted that these increases are concentrated in the period between April and July. For 2003, the forecast for the readjustment of these tariffs has declined to 12.7% from 13.0% in March. 
4. The inflation forecasts were based on the new specification of the structural model that has as its explanatory variable the 180-days swap DI-pre, which replaces both the Selic rate and the slope of the term structure of the interest rate. The projection for the nominal swap for the next quarters, keeping the Selic rate constant, starts in the current plateau of 18.6% to reach 19.5% at the end of 2002, 
5. The trajectory of U.S Fed Funds rate, based on the futures contracts maturity, was changed to reflect a 1.8% average rate in the second quarter of 2002, increasing to 3.0% in the fourth quarter of 2002, remaining constant thereafter, 
6. The sovereign risk premium measured by spread over treasury of Brazil’s Global 04 Bond is forecasted to remain at around 550 b.p., 
The core inflation of the IPCA, calculated under the symmetric trimmed-mean method, increased to 0.58% in March from 0.54% in February. In the last 12 months, this core registered a 7.58% increase. In turn, the IPC-BR core inflation, calculated under the symmetric trimmed-mean method, increased to 0.50% in March from 0.44% in February. In the accumulated over 12 months, this core registered a 7.46% variation. The core inflation calculated by excluding the prices administered by contracts (considering the wide set of these items weighting 30.3% of the IPCA in March) and household food prices increased by 0.53% in March, accumulating 6.10% in 12 months. 
The accumulated variation of the IPCA in 12 months was 7.75%, a rate above the observed in February (7.51%) and January (7.62%). The free prices contributed to inflation with 4.68 p.p. and the prices administered by contracts and monitored, with 3.07 p.p.. The inflation expectations surveyed by the Banco Central do Brasil's Investor Relations Group (GCI) registered a 5.4% increase for 2002 and stability for 2003 at 4.0%. 
Regarding fiscal policy, the hypothesis of achieving the primary surplus targets for the consolidated public sector, as stated in the Economic Program of the Government, was maintained, as well as the remaining assumptions established in the previous meeting. 
From the simulation exercises with several specifications of the structural model, the conclusion was that the maintenance of the interest rate at 18.5% p.a. and the exchange rate at the same plateau as on the eve of the Copom meeting indicate an inflation above 4.5% in 2002 and below 3.25% in 2003. 
The Brazilian economy continues to recover, albeit at a slow pace. Industrial production increased for the fourth consecutive month, reaching its highest level in February since May 2001 (seasonally adjusted figures). However, these positive variations have been showing decline: 0.2% in February compared to 1.7% in November, in the monthly comparisons. 
The consumption level has stabilized in the past months. The rebound in investment in this period has helped maintain the positive growth rate of the economy. In the monthly comparison, the 6.4% growth in the production of capital goods more than offset the almost 2% fall in the production of consumer goods. The retail turnover of the commerce in the metropolitan region of São Paulo remained practically unaltered between February and March. 
In the medium term, there are prospects of consumption growth, as indicated in the 5% increase in the consumer future intentions index, according to Fecomércio. This improvement of future intentions is consistent with the perspective of real wage mass growth, which should encourage the production of non-durable and semi-durable consumer goods. A recovery of the credit to the private sector would foster the production of durable consumer goods. 
The performance of the external sector remains positive. The outcome of February represented the seventh consecutive fall in the current account deficit, which reached US$21.4 billion in the past twelve months. In March, this deficit should be below US$20 billion. Brazil's risk, as measured by the spread over treasury of the Global Bond Br04, retreated by 30b.p. between March and April Copom meetings. The flow of foreign capital remains satisfactory in terms of the financing of the Balance of Payments. In this period, the Real appreciated by around 5 cents of a Dollar. Structural factors already mentioned in the previous Copom Minutes have contributed to this improvement. Within these factors, special notice should be given to the recovery of the U.S. economy, the limited contagion of the Argentine crisis in Brazil, and the macroeconomic fundamentals. Also reflecting this improvement, and evidencing confidence in the favorable performance of the external sector are the sovereign bond issuance, the well succeeded selling of Vale do Rio Doce's shares in the foreign market, and the decision to anticipate the payments of the Supplemental Reserve Facility (SRF) loan with the IMF, amounting to US$4.2 billion.. 
The macroeconomic picture points to a future reduction in the variation of the free prices in the basic scenario analyzed by Copom. The existence of high idle capacity, the still slow pace of the economic activity, and the absence of pressures from the labor market, as well as the appreciation of the exchange rate, the fall in wholesale price indices, and the recent behavior of food prices should contribute to a downward pressure in the inflation of free prices. It is expected that these prices will increase, on average, by around 0.20-0.30% p.m. throughout the remainder of the year. 
Nonetheless, inflation has remained at a high level in these first months of the year. The IPCA increase to 0.60% in March from 0.36% in February was not only due to the increase in prices administered by contracts and monitored, but also in response to a slower deceleration in the inflation of free prices in February and March of respectively 0.64% and 0.45%. 
The prices administered by contracts and monitored increased by 0.95% in March, due to the readjustments of prices of oil derivatives and electricity tariffs. The rises of 10.4% in the price of gasoline, and of 10.25% in bottled gas, will increase the inflation index in April. The pressure from prices administered by contracts and monitored should be concentrated between April and July this year, as a result of the recent readjustments of prices of oil derivatives and the concentration of price readjustments by the electricity distributing and telecommunications companies in the period. However, the curves of future prices of petroleum, gasoline and propane gas indicate a decrease of their prices in the remainder of the year. 
The increase in the projection of the prices administered by contracts and monitored raised the estimate for the primary effect of the shock of these prices to a value around 1 p.p.. The shock of the prices administered by contracts and monitored is defined as the value that exceeds the inflation target, once deducted the impact of the exchange rate pass-through and of the inertia over theses prices. It is important to emphasize that the increase in prices administered by contracts and monitored have further effects on the freely set prices through its secondary effects. 
The slower fall in the freely set prices and the higher inflation of the prices administered by contracts and monitored have led to an increase in the inflation expectations surveyed by the Investor Relations Group (GCI) of Banco Central do Brasil, to 5.4% in 2002. Similarly, the simulations carried out by the Banco Central also point to a rise in the projected inflation for 2002. The baseline scenario projects a variation between 4.5% and 5.0% for this year. The higher projection was due to the 0.60% inflation in March, reflecting the slower decrease of the freely set prices, and to the revision of the projections for the administered prices, which increased to 7.2% from 6.8% between March and April Copom meetings. For 2003, the projected inflation is below the 3.25% target. 
In principle the monetary policy should be guided towards coping with the spill-over of the shocks of prices administered by contracts and monitored, but not their primary effect. Besides, part of the inflationary inertia inherited from 2001 may be neutralized in 2003. As a result, and also considering the new estimate for the primary effect of the shock from administered prices, the Copom aims at an inflation rate between 4.5% and 5.0% for 2002. However, as the projection for the inflation this year rises, the risk of inflation reaching the upper limit of the tolerance interval also increases. This risk assumes a relevant role in the current context of the monetary policy, which seeks to guarantee the convergence of the inflation to the trend of its targets after the shocks that hit the economy in 2001, under a regime that is still maturing. 
In summary, the slower convergence of inflation to its targets, together with the secondary effect of the shocks in prices administered by contracts and monitored and the proximity to the ceiling of the tolerance interval, recommends caution in conducting the monetary policy.
"
03/06/2002;71;Arminio Fraga;"The indicators of performance of the economic activity showed, at the end of the first quarter, signs of slowing of the recovery started in October 2001. This tendency is only partially explained by inventory level adjustments, mainly by industry, and to possible statistical seasonality effects that diminish March results. The loss of impetus is also attributed to the still modest growth of the payroll, the absence of a more expressive recovery in credit , plus the exhaustion of the process of recovery of consumer expectations that had been present since the end of last year. Retail commerce was significantly influenced in the last two months by Easter holidays The recovery of business activity observed since the end of last year came to a halt in the Metropolitan Region of São Paulo, as identified by April sales figures. The latter registered a 1.9% drop in real turnover for the month, compared to a 2.3% growth in March, according to the seasonally adjusted data from São Paulo State's Federation of Commerce (Fecomércio). From the analysis by segments it is evident that the decline in supermarket sales was the main reason. The supermarket sector declined 9.3%, compared to an 8% growth in the previous month when Easter holidays boosted business. Other segments less influenced by April seasonality factors showed expansion in the month, such as durable consumer goods, which grew by 2.4%, whilst sales of cars grew 7.5%. 
According to the São Paulo Trade Association (ACSP), the enquiries to the Credit Protection Service (SPC) increased by 4.6% in April in comparison with March (seasonally adjusted figures), which coincided with the sales pattern of durable goods. Likewise, the enquiries to Usecheque increased by 7%. According to the same institution, the default rate rose to 9.4% in April from 6% in the observed series and increased to 5.8% from 4.9% in the seasonally adjusted series, reaching the same levels observed in April 2001. The default rate measured by the ratio of checks returned due to insufficient funds and those cleared declined slightly to 5% in April, compared to 5.2% in March. 
Year-to-date retail commerce activity declined compared to the same period of 2001. According to IBGE's survey, the accumulated decline was 0.8% up to March and, specifically for the Metropolitan Region of São Paulo, according to data from Fecomercio, the accumulated decline is 3.8% up to April. It should be noted, however, that the growth in income generated by the agriculture and livestock sector has stimulated consumption outside the metropolitan regions. The better performance in the countryside partly explains the less accentuated negative results of the national statistics compared with those of the Metropolitan Region of São Paulo. 
Consumer expectations are amongst the factors that explain the current cooling down of economic activity. The Index of Consumer Intentions (IIC), released by Fecomércio, registered growth     throughout this year up to April, but at declining rates. In May, the growth sequence was interrupted and the index fell by 0.9%, showing a fall in the indicators that both reflect current conditions and that signal future conditions.
The survey of the National Confederation of Industry also showed a slight reduction in entrepreneurial confidence in April, reaching 58.9 compared to 59.9 in the January survey. The worse evaluation of the current conditions of the Brazilian economy was a reflection of the weaker levels of activity of the sector and enterprises taking part in the survey. However, the index remained above 50, indicating that entrepreneurs are still confident, mainly in regard to the expectations for the next six months, which remained practically stable at 64.5 from 64.7 in the previous survey. 
Industrial production declined by 0.8% in March, according to seasonally adjusted data released by the IBGE, interrupting the sequence of four consecutive months of growth. Three out of the four categories of uses registered decline: 4% in the production of capital goods, 1.5% in intermediary goods and 1.9% in semi-durable and non-durable consumer goods. The production of durable consumer goods was the only one to grow by 1%, in comparison with the previous month. The analysis by sectors, however, shows that the deceleration in industry was not generalized, as 8 out of the 20 surveyed industrial sectors registered expansion. Of the sectors that registered negative results, the food industry showed the worst performance, possibly attributed to inventory adjustment, since the same sector had shown particularly high production in the first two months of this year. The increase in inventories may also be one of the reasons for the slower production levels of industry as a whole. The industrial survey carried out by the CNI reveals that inventory levels of final products increased in April compared to the beginning of the year. Excessive inventory levels were also detected by the Business Scenario Survey of the Processing Industry, carried out by FGV, but simultaneously revealed a reduction in the intentions of lowering inventory levels in coming months.
The weak performance of the production of electric power generating equipment in March was the main reason for the month by month decline in the production of capital goods. On an accumulated   basis, however, capital goods production still show a growth of 8.7% in the first quarter, in comparison to the same period of 2001. Year to date, the expansion rates registered in the production of agricultural machinery and industrial commissioned built goods, 9.9% and 7.2% respectively, are noteworthy, indicating an increase in the production capacity in these sectors. Although on a yearly basis the production of material for the civil construction industry still registered a decline, it has grown for the last three consecutive months, to March, thus contributing to the share increase of the Gross Capital Formation in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to 18.8%, according to a forecast of current values released by BCB's Economic Department (Depec). 
Regarding the performance of the primary sector, the Continuous Survey of Agricultural Production, carried out by the IBGE in March, estimated that total grain production should reach 98.6 million tons in 2002, remaining stable in relation to the total harvest of 2001. It should be highlighted that the increase in the production of staple foods is of great importance to the price of the basic consumer basket. A typical example is the production of beans and rice, which has already caused declines of 15.2% and 10.5%, respectively, in the prices of these products in the first quarter of 2002, according to the Consumer Price Index – Extended (IPCA). 
The formal employment index increased again in March (0.4% in the seasonally adjusted series), reflecting the creation of 90 thousand job positions during the month in the labor market, according to data released by the Ministry of Labor and Employment. IBGE's monthly employment survey also registered an increase in the number of active workers in March  even so, since the 1.3% expansion was lower than the total increase in the number of unemployed workers, the unemployment rate rose to 7.1%, from 7% in February in the non seasonally adjusted series. The IBGE survey also showed a 0.26% drop in the average real wage, considering the seasonally adjusted series. It should be emphasized, however, that only service sector workers suffered a real average wage decline of 2.3%. The earnings of the workers employed in manufacturing, in commerce, in civil construction, and in other activities increased by 1.5%, 1.3%, 0.3% and 1.2%, respectively, in relation to the previous month. By occupations, there was a 0.3% increase in the real average wage of those formally and informally hired , and reductions of , respectively, 3.0% and 2.1% in the earnings of self-employed and employers
The total stock of credit operations of the domestic financial system increased by 1%, in April, reaching R$ 338.8 billion. The operations with freely allocated resources reached R$ 199.5 billion, maintaining the trend of moderate growth, with variations of 1.2% in April and 3.5% in the year. The stock of credit contracted by private individuals grew by 2% in the month, with expansion in all modalities of operations, especially overdraft accounts (3.6%), and acquisition of vehicles (1.6%). The 1.2% growth in personal credit may be partially explained by the use of credit lines in anticipation of tax returns from the Internal Revenue. 
The stock of credit to companies increased by 0.7% in April, reaching R$ 124.2 billion. Modalities contracted with domestic resources increased by 0.4%, especially those that are typically short run, such as guaranteed overdraft accounts and hot money. In relation to the operations linked to foreign currency, the stock returned to January levels, R$ 41.5 billion, showing a 1.3% increase in the month. The 3.8% increase in foreign transfers was partially neutralized by the 1% drop in Foreign Exchange Advances (ACC), causing the total balance of operations to grow by less than the 1.7% exchange rate depreciation in April.
The average interest rates charged on credit operations dropped by 1.1 p.p. in April. This was due to the 2.2 p.p. reduction in average rates charged to private individuals, reflecting the sales promoted by institutions linked to vehicles' assemblers. On the other hand, the stability of the average rates charged on operations to companies resulted from the offsetting of the increases in the modalities of turnover capital, rediscounts and guaranteed overdraft accounts against the reductions in hot money and, mainly, in vendor lines.
Financing requirements fell, for the international transactions of the Brazilian economy, in the first four months of 2002. The current account deficit decreased to US$5.2 billion, compared to US$9 billion in the same period of 2001. Foreign direct investments, reached US$6.7 billion in the period and were more than enough to finance the entire current account deficit.
The reduction in the deficit of the services and income accounts plus the positive trade balance enabled the better current account performance. The trade balance accumulated a US$1.5 billion surplus in the first four months of 2002, compared to a US$561 million deficit in the same period in 2001. This reversion in the trade balance result came from a sharp decline in imports, 21.3%, which counterbalanced the 10.7% drop in exports, consequence of the retraction observed in important markets for Brazilian products. Part of the fall in imports was a result of lower exports of manufactured products, a group comprised of representative items and with an intensive use of imported components. Imports substitution by domestic production was another factor that restrained imports, since the decrease in imports was higher than that of the domestic industrial production. 
Summarizing, the economic recovery outlined in the last quarter of 2001 onwards was partially due to overcoming of the shocks that hit the economy last year. The recent cooling off in this expansion, observed in March and April, may be interpreted as a reflex of factors that tend to interfere with growth, such as: a) the small increase in credit and income, aggravated by conjuncture factors that contributed to negatively influence domestic expectations  b) readjustments of energy and fuel prices and their impacts on inflation indices  and c) the depreciation of the exchange rate. The slower growth of the economic activity created a slight increase in inventories to above desired levels in the sectors of production, as registered in the sector's recent performance. However, production should not keep on declining. Some sector indicators in April confirm this expectation i.e. vehicle production and corrugated paper, amongst others. In regardo to demand, a number of favorable factors can be cited such as the growth in income related to agricultural activities, the labor market improvement, continued government expenditure in social programs, plus the beginning of the payment of installments related to the Time in Service Guarantee Fund (FGTS) losses agreement. 
In the United States, the prudent optimism of economic recovery prevailed. The most recent indicators however, still presented contradictory signs, a phenomenon peculiar to phases of     economic cycle inversion. The 5.8% GDP growth in the first quarter was influenced by one off factors, such as the increase of 20% in defense expenditures and 22.6% in private investment, mainly in inventory, while final demand increased by only 3.7%, a slower pace than in the previous quarter. The 8.6% growth in productivity was accompanied by a 5.3% fall in unit labor cost and an increase in the unemployment rate to 6% in April from 5.7% in March. The increase in unemployment is associated with the return of the previously discouraged to the labor market, since the number of employed remained practically stable during the same period
The retail commerce sales (excluding food services) increased by 1.3% in April, according to seasonally adjusted data, 3.7% above those in April 2001. Industrial production continued to rise for the fourth consecutive month, in April, by 4%, increasing the level of industrial capacity utilization to 75.5%. In the same month, the producer's prices index (PPI) declined 0.1%, maintaining a downward trend, although consumer inflation (CPI) increased, accumulating 1.6% in the 12 months up to April. 
On the other hand, business and consumer expectation indicators showed signs that the recovery of the U.S. economy will not be as quick as the more optimistic forecasts make believe. In spite of remaining above the leveling off mark of 50 (activity expansion), the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) declined to 53.9% in April from 55.6% in March, while the services' index measured by the Business Activity Index (BAI) dropped to 55.3% in April from 57.3% in March, both surveyed by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM, former-NAPM). The Conference Board indicators show a similar trend, with a decline in the Consumer Confidence Index to 108.8 in April from 110.7 in March, and a drop of 0.4% in the Leading Indicator, the first decline in six months.
In the Euro Area, statistical information takes longer to be released, but they show a slower and still uncertain economic recovery. Retail sales grew by 0.5% in February, compared to the previous month, showing that domestic demand is providing only a small contribution to economic growth recovery. The progress of industrial production is also timid, with an increase of only 0.5% in March, but an annual decline of 2.9%, mainly due to Germany's performance, with a fall of 0.8% in the month, and 10.3% over 12 months. The behavior of the German economy affected the     country's business sector expectations, interrupting the recent recovery trend. Nonetheless, the expectations of French and Italian businessmen continued to show optimism and a trend towards recovery. The 2.2% annual inflation rate stayed over ECB's reference level. The trade balance surplus continued to increase up to February, the last month of available data, as imports have been declining more than exports, a trend that may change due to the euro appreciation observed since February.
The main price indices showed an increase in the rate of inflation in April, due to the rise in monitored prices of gasoline, bottled gas and electricity tariffs in some capitals. On the other hand, the inflation of the free prices showed a higher deceleration than in the previous months, influenced by the negative variation in the food prices. 
The IPCA increased by 0.8% in April, accumulating a rise of 2.3% in the year and 7.98% in the last twelve months. The 8.7% rise in gasoline prices, in consequence of the readjustments of 9.39% on March 16th and 10.08% on April 6th in the refineries selling prices, contributed with 0.34 of a percentage point to the monthly variation. The price of bottled gas increased by 8.74% in consumer retail outlets. Gasoline and bottled gas together were responsible for 0.47 of a percentage point in the 0.8% IPCA variation in April. 
Still amongst monitored prices, the increase of 1.31% in the residential electricity tariff, in consequence of the readjustments in five capitals, and 0.28% in urban transport, due to the increase in the transport tariff in Fortaleza, should be noted. Considering the free prices, the deceleration in price rises was due mainly to the 0.32% negative variation in food prices, a result of the good harvest and the favorable meteorological conditions. 
The General Price Index – Domestic Supply (IGP-DI) varied by 0.7% in April, compared to 0.48% in the first quarter, accumulating 1.18% in the year and 8.68% in the last twelve months. The rise in the monthly variation was due equally to the effects of the readjustment of fuel prices in the     Wholesale Price Index (IPA), specially the ones of the chemical industry, and in the Consumer Price Index (IPC), in transport (gasoline) and housing (bottled gas) items. The decline of food prices maintained a negative variation in the agricultural IPA, softening the rise of the industrial IPA and of the IPC. The IPA monthly variation reached 0.75%, compared to 0.1% accumulated in the first quarter, following the 1.3% rise of the industrial prices in the month, against 0.08% in the quarter. The IPC rose by 0.71% in April, compared to 0.42% in March, accumulating 2.07% for the year. 
The main pressures on the prices indices for May will come again from the increase in monitored prices, albeit at a lower level than registered in April. In addition to the residual effect of the recent readjustments in fuel and electricity, the readjustment in the transport tariff in Rio de Janeiro should affect the consumer indices. In the wholesale area, the decline of food prices should continue, although at a lower rate, since the preliminary results of the IGP-M showed some recovery in the prices of cereals and meat. In three out of the eleven surveyed capitals, the workers' wage renegotiations in the civil construction sector should significantly impact on the increase of the variation of the National Index of Civil Construction (INCC), with a consequent impact on the IGP-DI monthly variation. 
After the last Copom decision to keep the Over-Selic rate at 18.50%, the yield curve, which had indicated a reduction of approximately 25 b.p, shifted upwards for all maturities. For maturities of up to 1-month, the negative slope shifted to a positive one, and, for longer ones, the slope shifted upwards. Since then, the yield curve behavior was influenced, mainly, by the uncertainties stemming from the electoral process, by the unfavorable evaluations of the country risk and also by the increase in the Brazil EMBI, which rose to 968 points on May 22nd from 733 on April 17th . The spread between the 1-year interest rate and the Over-Selic target increased to 226 b.p from 49 b.p.     In the period between April 18th and May 22nd , the National Treasury and Banco Central carried out ten auctions to rollover NBCE and NTN-D totaling R$ 9.6 billion. For the first rollover of R$ 5.0 billion in NBCE and NTN-D maturing on May 8th, the following auctions were carried out: two for exchange rate swaps conjugated to LFT at two and three year tenures, two NTN-D auctions at two year tenure, and one exchange rate swap auction at three year tenure. For the second rollover of R$ 4.6 billion in NBCE, redeeming on May 16th , five exchange rate swap auctions were carried out on May 10th and May 14th. After May 7th, the rollovers were exclusively carried out with exchange rate swaps, which led to a significant reduction in the premiums. 
At the same time, the National Treasury offered 7 and 12 month-tenure LTNs. The short tenure securities were offered in the five weekly sales events in the period, while the 12-month tenure LTNs were only offered in the first week. The total financial volume of the placements reached R$ 7.2 billion, of which 94% referred to the placements of securities maturing in 2002. 
Considering the financial settlements that occurred between April 17th and May 21st, there was an expansionary monetary impact of R$ 14.0 billion, resulting mainly from the R$ 5.0 billion redemptions of LFT, the R$ 6.2 billion placement of LFT conjugated to exchange rate swaps, and the R$ 14.9 net redemptions of dollar-indexed securities. 
On April 19th, in order to guarantee liquidity at the beginning of the Brazilian Payment System (SPB) and also to deconcentrate the return of the operations, BCB carried out eight go-arounds, providing and withdrawing liquidity at 2 to 5 working day tenures. Due to the reduction in the number of transactions in the market of bank reserves after the beginning of SPB, Banco Central modified the way it intervenes in the money market, starting to carry out go-arounds at pre-defined spreads in the morning, and leveling off liquidity at the end of the day. In nineteen intervention through go-arounds, Banco Central provided liquidity at a minimum yield of 18.43% p.a, with a R$ 2.3 billion average volume and at an average term of 2.2 days. In twenty five interventions, Banco Central withdrew liquidity at the maximum yield of 18.40% p.a, an average volume of R$ 6.7 billion and an average term of 1.2 day. Moreover, Banco Central carried out two auctions of     LFT repurchase amounting to R$ 3.1 billion, and also R$ 270 million in swap of LFT maturing in February 2003 by LFT maturing in 2006. There were three selling operations of federal securities with repurchase agreements at open unit prices of return, at two and three month tenures, with only the first one being with free transactions of securities.
In April, the domestic federal securitized debt increased by R$ 7.0 billion or 1.1% compared to the previous month. This rise was inferior to the variation of the Over-Selic rate and to the exchange rate depreciation in the period, basically due to the net redemption of R$ 5.5 billion. Due to the R$ 4.2 billion net placements of LTN, the relative share of fixed-rate securities in the total debt increased to 9.8% at the end of April, from 9.1% at the end of March. Incorporating the LFT conjugated with exchange rate swaps, the dollar-indexed debt increased by R$ 3.0 billion, although maintaining its participation in the total debt practically steady at around 28.8%. Under this same concept, the LFT debt fell by R$ 3.4 billion, reducing its relative share in the total to 50.1% from 51.2%. 
The identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed in the light of newly available information. The scenario considered in the simulations assumes the following hypotheses: 
1. April inflation rate, measured by the IPCA, increased to 0.80% from 0.60% in March  
2. The forecasts for prices of petroleum by-products assumed the following parameters: the behavior of the exchange rate  the spot and future prices of gasoline in the United States for the gasoline readjustments, and the spot price of the propane gas in the United States as well as the futures prices negotiated in the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) for the readjustments of the bottled gas. For 2002 as a whole, a 6.6% decline is forecasted due to the fall in gasoline prices in January and February. This percentage figure is the same as was forecasted in the last Copom meeting. This forecast has been maintained despite the exchange rate depreciation, since the latter was offset by a lower-than-expected readjustment of gasoline consumer prices in April     and a lower than expected increase of prices in the refinery in May, as defined by Petrobrás. For bottled gas, a 29% increase is forecasted for 2002, of which 26.1% has already occurred between January and April  
3. The average increase of electricity tariffs in 2002 is estimated at 18%, compared to the projection of 15% in April. This revision was due mainly to the exchange rate depreciation. For 2003, the forecast for the readjustment of electricity tariffs was increased to 13.6% from 12.7% forecast in April. These price rises are concentrated within the period of April to July 
4. Regarding the set of prices administered by contracts and monitored, with a weighting of 30.4% in the IPCA of April, the expected readjustments are 7.6% for 2002, and 4.5% for 2003, with a direct contribution of 2.3 p.p. and 1.4 p.p. for the IPCA. In the April meeting, the expected readjustments for these prices were 7.2% and 4.3%, respectively 
5. The inflation forecasts were based on the new specification of the structural model that has the 180-days pre-fixed DI swap as its explanatory variable, replacing both the Selic rate and the slope of the term structure of the interest rate. The projection for the 6-months spread over the Selic rate is based on a new specification. An error correction model is used. This model includes the Selic rate and the swap rate. The estimated value starts from the current plateau, near zero, to reach -100 b.p. at the end of 2003. This forecast was based on the hypotheses of a constant Selic rate at 18.5% up to the end of 2003 
6. The trend of the U.S. Fed Funds rate, based on the futures contracts maturities, was changed to reflect a 1.8% average rate in the second quarter of 2002, increasing to 2.7% in the first quarter of 2003, stabilizing thereafter  
7. The sovereign risk premium, based on the spread over treasury of Brazil’s Global 08 Bond is forecasted to decline to around 700 b.p. for 2003 from the current plateau of 780 b.p..     
The core inflation of the IPCA, calculated under the symmetric trimmed-mean method, declined to 0.56% in April from 0.58% in March. In the last 12 months, this core registered a 7.68% variation. The IPC-BR core inflation, calculated under the symmetric trimmed-mean method, declined to 0.46% in April from 0.50% in March. In the accumulated over 12 months, this core registered a 7.27% variation. Core inflation calculated by excluding the prices administered by contracts and monitored (considering the wide set of these items weighted 30.4% in the IPCA in March) and household food prices registered a 0.46% variation in April, accumulating 6.31% in 12 months. 
The accumulated variation of the IPCA in 12 months was 7.98%, above the rate observed in March (7.75%) and February (7.51%). The free prices contributed with 4.48% p.p. to inflation and the prices administered by contracts and monitored contributed with 3.70 p.p.. The inflation expectations surveyed by the BCB’s Investor Relations Group (GCI) registered a slight increase for 2002, reaching 5.46%, and stablizing at 4.00% for 2003. 
Regarding the fiscal policy, the hypothesis of achieving the primary surplus targets for the consolidated public sector, as stated in the Economic Program of the Government, was maintained, as well as the remaining assumptions established in the previous meeting. 
From the simulation exercises with several specifications of the structural model, it has been concluded that the maintenance of the interest rate at 18.5% p.a. and the exchange rate at the same plateau as on the eve of the Copom meeting indicates an inflation rate a little over 5.0% in 2002 and below the 3.25% target in 2003. 
The recovery of the Brazilian economy over the last few months is showing signs of slowing down. Industrial production declined by 0.8% in March compared to the previous month (seasonally adjusted data). Regarding retail commerce, real sales in the metropolitan region of São     Paulo fell by 1.96% in April (seasonally adjusted data), according to Fecomércio. The Consumer Intentions Index fell in May, after increasing for six consecutive months.
This result was partially offset by the fact that the Easter fell in March. The loss of impetus is also attributed to, the phasing out of the recovery process in consumer expectations, to the end of the cycle of inventory re-composition, to the still modest growth of the payroll, to the lack of credit recovery, and, more recently, to the steeper slope of the yield curve. 
In spite of the above scenario there are no indications that the economy is heading for recession. The consumption of durable goods would increase as a result of the end of the electricity rationing and the approach of the World Cup. It is also expected that the elections stimulate some specific sectors, such as the electro-electronics, paper and pulp, and textiles. In addition, some indicators show that the real payroll has grown since January 2002 and that the level of industrial employment has increased since December 2001, according to CNI data (seasonally adjusted). The beginning of payment of the installments related to the FGTS agreement should trigger consumption. 
The performance of the external sector remains positive. The current account deficit accumulated in 12 months up to April (US$19.4 billion) was entirely financed by the net inflows of foreign direct investment, which reached US$22.4 billion in the same period. From January to April 2002, the US$5.2 billion current account deficit was also entirely financed by the net inflows of foreign direct investment, which totaled US$ 6.7 billion
Nonetheless, the country risk and the exchange rate have not reflected these good performance of the external sector. Since the Copom meeting of April, the country risk as measured by the Embi+ increased to 940 b.p. from 733 b.p., and the Real depreciated by 7.6%. 
Inflation measured by the IPCA was 0.80% in April, 0.20 p.p. above March inflation. Prices administered by contracts and monitored increased by 2.07%, influenced by the price readjustments of oil by-products, and those of free prices (0.24%). The variation of free prices has     declined since February 2002. After reaching 0.64% in February, the monthly variation fell to 0.45% and 0.24% in the two following months. The downward inflationary trend of free prices is projected to continue during 2002 and 2003. 
In relation to prices administered by contracts and monitored, Petrobras announced a 1.06% reduction in the price of gasoline at refineries and the maintenance of the bottled gas price. The projection for the inflation of the set of prices administered by contracts and monitored in 2002 is 7.6%, compared to 7.2% forecast in the Copom meeting of April. This projection embodies the increases of urban bus tariffs in the cities of Rio de Janeiro (9.09%) and Salvador (10.0%). The projection increase derives basically from the exchange rate depreciation that took place between the Copom meetings of April and May. 
Shock of prices administered by contracts and monitored is defined as the value that exceeds the inflation target, once deducted the impact of the exchange rate pass-through and the inertia over these prices. As the exchange rate depreciated, the impact of its pass-through on the prices administered by contracts and monitored increased. However, the projection for the inflation of prices administered by contracts and monitored did not rise in the same proportion of this impact and, thus, the primary effect of the shock of prices administered by contracts and monitored declined to below 1 p.p.
According to the models used by BCB, the projection of the variation of IPCA for 2002 increased since the April meeting and is slightly over 5.0%. The revision was due almost exclusively to the exchange rate depreciation in the period
The impact of the exchange rate variation on the inflation projection may be lower than usually predicted which was taken into account in the projection. There are two factors that may induce the recent depreciation of the real to have a relatively smaller than expected impact on inflation. Firstly, the cooling down of economic recovery should inhibit the exchange rate pass-through to the prices. Secondly, in a floating exchange rate regime, the impact of an exchange rate variation on prices should be reduced when the agents perceive this variation as temporary. Thus, in the first     quarter of 2002, the appreciation of the real did not lead to a negative readjustment of prices possibly because the economic agents set prices taking into account a more depreciated exchange rate than actually observed. Thus, the exchange rate variation that is relevant for the economic agents between the first and second quarters of this year should be less significant than actually observed, causing weaker inflationary pressure. However, this does not mean that further exchange rate depreciations will have the same reduced effect on prices. 
It is worth noting that, even if the economic agents made their decisions based on the effectively observed exchange rate, which would imply in a higher pass-through of the depreciation to inflation, the projected IPCA for 2002 would still be below the upper limit of the 5.5% target.
For 2003, the projected IPCA is below the target of 3.25%, with an estimated variation in prices administered by contracts and monitored of 4.5%. The low inflation in 2003 should result not only from the lower inflation of the free prices, but also from the convergence of the general price indices, which are used as the reference for the readjustment of prices administered by contracts and monitored in the IPCA. 
The inflation expectations surveyed by the Investor Relations Group (GCI) of the BCB are still pointing to a declining trend in inflation in the near future. For 2002 and 2003, the expectations are converging to a figure below 5.5% and around 4.0%, respectively.
The members of Copom considered that the projected downward trend of inflation in 2002 and 2003 forecasted by BCB, reinforced by the market expectations, would recommend a resumption in the process of monetary policy easing, specially in a context of an observed decrease in the inflation of free prices and a trend in economic activity that should not pose inflationary pressures.
However, there was not a consensus on the adequate timing to resume the process of reduction of the basic interest rate. Despite the projection of inflation for 2003 being below the target, the majority of the members considered that the balance of risks for 2002 - the worsening of the country risk, the recent exchange rate depreciation, and the proximity of inflation projections to the     ceiling of the target interval – recommends the confirmation of the downward trend of the inflation rate before the easing of monetary policy, which still has an impact on the outcome of this year’s results. 
"
28/06/2002;72;Arminio Fraga;"The economic activity continues to show gradual expansion, albeit at a slower pace than at the beginning of the year. The initial perception of stronger growth was partly due to a statistical seasonality effect, created by Easter holidays falling earlier this year, in March. The latter has a strengthening effect on the seasonally adjusted results in April. In fact, there are signs of economic slowdown, evident from, among other factors, the recent outcomes of both consumer and entrepreneur expectation surveys. 
The economic recovery was confirmed by the growth of 1.3% in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the first quarter of 2002, compared to the previous quarter, according to seasonally adjusted indexes released by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). Compared to the same quarter of 2001, GDP declined by 0.73%, mostly due to the sequence of shocks that occurred between the two periods rather than by an adverse result in the quarter in reference. In addition to the favorable performance of the agricultural and livestock sectors, the output of the services sector continued to increase, particularly due to the good results of the communications sub-sector, which still reflected the investment cycle initiated after the privatization of the telecommunication companies. 
In April, industrial production increased by 4.1%, seasonally adjusted data, with an increase of 7.1% in the production of capital goods, 7.2% in consumer goods and 2.4% in intermediary goods. These good results, as previously mentioned, were influenced by the Easter Holiday falling in March this year. This fact is not offset in the seasonal adjustment process, and thus atypically increased the results in April and similarly reduced them in May. 
The Continuous Survey of Agricultural Production, carried out by the IBGE in April, forecasted that in the primary sector, the total grain production in 2002 should reach 99.3 million tons, an expansion of 0.8% in relation to the 2001 harvest. It should be highlighted that the increase in the production of beans and rice, which are products of great importance to the basic consumer basket, caused reductions in their prices. The latter had a favorable influence on inflation in the first months of 2002. In addition, the growth in the harvested crop of soybeans and the higher production of oranges should contribute positively to the trade balance. On the other hand, the reduction in the harvested crop of corn may lead to an increase in the cost of livestock production and require imports to supply the domestic demand. 
Regarding demand indicators, retail commerce has shown a roller coast pattern of monthly ups and downs throughout the year. This fact is partly explained by the seasonality effect of Easter coming in March and reflecting in April too. However, the latter trend reveals a loss of dynamism in the process of recovery of the sector – initiated in the second semester of 2001, attributed to the still low growth in income and credit. On the other hand, Mother’s day and the proximity of the World Cup contributed to sales in May, according to the preliminary data from the São Paulo State’s Federation of Commerce (Fecomércio), which shows a 3.2% growth in the monthly sales (seasonally adjusted data). 
The volume of credit operations further revealed more moderate expansion. The total balance of those operations in the domestic financial system reached R$ 343.4 billion in May, with increases of 1.3% in the month and 2.7% in the quarter ending in May. The operations with freely allocated resources totaled R$ 201.8 billion, increasing by 1.2% in the month, particularly due to a 1.6% growth in the stock of credit granted to private individuals. Noteworthy are the increases of 2.1% in personal credit in the month and 1.4% in the financing of automobiles in the month, 9.4% accumulated in the year. 
The stock of credit operations for corporations increased 0.9% in the month. With the 6.7% exchange rate depreciation in May, this expansion was concentrated in the credit lines linked to foreign resources, which grew by 4.4% in the month. On the other hand, the stock of credit lines granted with domestic resources declined by 0.8%, indicating that companies may be liquidating debts and postponing their banking credit requirements. 
The average prefixed interest rate charged on credit operations increased by 0.4% p.p. in May. This trend was a result of the increase of the interest rates in the futures market, which raised the average cost of funding. The banking spread declined by 0.3%p.p. in the month. The default rate in operations with freely allocated resources increased by 0.2% to reach 8.9%. The percentage of operations with private individuals in arrears grew by 0.1 p.p., reaching 15.2%, whilst the same figure related to companies remained stable at 4.9%. 
The credit conditions and the high default rate have affected consumer expectations. The Index of Consumer Intentions (IIC), released by Fecomércio declined by 12.3% in June, reflecting sharp drops both in the current and future consumer intentions. Furthermore, the index was influenced by concerns regarding unemployment and by the unease related to the development of the country’s political scenario and the international environment. 
Investment, which is another demand component, is showing a partial recovery from the deceleration observed in the last months of 2001. The shift in results is a consequence of the evolution of the production of both capital goods and basic materials for the civil construction industry, as confirmed by recently released indicators for April, bearing in mind the influence of the seasonality effect in this case too. In the month, there were increases of 2.2% in the production of civil construction materials, 6.2% in the production of machinery and equipment and 6.2% in the quantum of imported capital goods, seasonally adjusted data. Another indicator of business investment decisions is the financing granted by the National Bank of Economic and Social Development (BNDES), which increased by 29% in the first five months of 2002 compared to the same period of 2001. The BNDES financing requires a 40% to 50% complement from the investor. 
Regarding the evolution of investment flows, it should be highlighted that despite the recovery trend observed in the last few months, the absorption of capital goods declined by 4.9% in the first quarter, in comparison to the same period of 2001. This was a result of the combination of the 0.3% growth of domestic production, an 18% decline in imports of capital goods, and to the 12.5% fall in the exports of capital goods. 
In the labor market, the increase in the formal employment index is worth noting. There was a 0.4% increase in April, in the seasonally adjusted series, reflecting the creation of 175 thousand job positions, according to the Ministry of Labor and Employment. However, the IBGE’s Monthly Employment Survey registered an increase in the unemployment rate to 7.6%, from 7.1% in March, mainly as a result of the 7.5% increase in the number of unemployed, since the number of employed workers declined by 0.2%. The decline in the number of active workers was mainly due to the slowdown of the civil construction industry and of commerce, whilst the manufacturing industry showed a 2.3% increase. Data released by the National Confederation of Industries (CNI) indicated a similar trend, apart from revealing an increase in the real payroll. 
As for the external transactions of the Brazilian economy, the current account deficit declined to US$ 7 billion during the January-May 2002 period, compared to US$ 11.2 billion deficit registered in the same period of 2001. The current account deficit in the January to May 2002 period was totally financed by the net inflow of foreign direct investment, which reached US$ 8.1 billion. 
The better current account result reflected the reduction of the deficit in the services and income accounts and, principally the reversal of the trade balance, which reached a US$ 1,933 million surplus in the first five months of 2002, in comparison to a deficit of US$ 353 million in the same period of 2001. The shift in the trade balance result was due to the 21.4% fall in imports, as the contraction of important markets for Brazilian products led to a 12.2% decline in exports. Moreover, soybean exports have been delayed this year, in spite of the growth in the production, as the sector is well capitalized and awaits the right moment to trade an important part of the current harvest. Regarding the decline in imports, in addition to the impacts of the substitution of purchases abroad by domestic producers, the decline in exports of manufactured goods, which have a high coefficient of utilization of imported raw materials and components, all had a noteworthy influence too. 
In summary, activity related to production is still growing, but shows some signs of deceleration. From the demand viewpoint, the positive effects of the increasing agricultural revenue and the beginning of the payment of the installments related to the agreement on the losses of the Time in Service Guarantee Fund (FGTS) are being, nevertheless offset by the deterioration of consumer expectations. 
In the United States, the scenario of recovery of economic activity is still unclear. The GDP growth in the first quarter was revised to 5.6% from 5.8%. The result was highly influenced by isolated factors, such as the increase in defense expenditures and private investments, mainly in inventories, whilst final demand evolved more slowly than in the previous quarter. The industrial production expanded by 0.1% in May, compared to the forecast of 0.3%, showing signs of deceleration. The level of utilization of the installed capacity remained stable at 75.5%. Industry and commerce inventories declined by 0.2% in April, despite the upward trend of the last months. There was a marginal improvement in the labor market, with a reduction in the unemployment rate to 5.8% in May from 6% in April and stability in the number of employees and hours worked, in addition to the retraction in the real average income. 
The retail commerce sales (excluding food services) declined by 0.9% in May, according to seasonally adjusted data, albeit being 1.9% above the sales of May 2001. In the same month, the producer's price index (PPI) once again registered negative variation (0.4%), with the highest fall of the last six months. The core index, which excludes food and energy price variations remained unchanged. The consumer prices continued to be stable in May, resulting in an annual variation of 1.2%, while the core index of consumer prices increased by 0.16% in the month, maintaining the 2.5% annual variation. The entrepreneur and consumer expectations remained on an upward trend, according to the indications of surveys by the Institute for Supply Management and the Conference Board. 
In Japan, the statistics revealed some positive signs of economic recovery. First estimates indicated that GDP grew by 1.4% in the first quarter of 2002, in comparison with the previous quarter, and 5.7% on an annual basis, geared by the performance of the external sector. Exports totaled US$ 32.9 billion in April, increasing by 3.8% over the same month of 2001, while the imports declined by 9.2% over the same period, reaching US$ 26.9 billion. The growth in the exports of automobiles and electronic goods should be highlighted. Industrial production increased by 0.2% in April, whilst inventories declined for the third consecutive month, and factory orders increased by 11.3%, indicating a recovery in commercial investments. The unemployment rate reached 5.2% in March, after remaining stable at 5.3% in the first two months of the year. 
In the Euro Area, after a long period of stagnation, the economy starts showing signs of moderate expansion. GDP grew by 0.2% in the first quarter of 2002, favored by export growth, despite the recent exchange rate appreciation. Domestic demand remained sluggish, with retail sales increasing only 0.3% in March, after rising by 0.5% in February. In May, the expectations of the entrepreneurial sector remained favorable in France and in Italy, improving in Germany, after an localized retraction in April. Consumer confidence is improving in France and in Germany and is stable in Italy. The inflation of consumer prices declined to 0.1% in May, and to 2% on an annual basis, favored by the drop in food prices, by the appreciation of the euro and even by the favorable statistical effect derived from the fact that May 2001 registered the highest rise of consumer prices in the year. 
In Argentina, the fall in the level of economic activity, the liquidity crisis, and the exchange rate market volatility persist. Industrial production shrank by 16.5% in April compared to the same month of 2001. The inflation showed signs of deceleration in May, but the price variation ytd is 25.9% in the consumer index and 80.4% in the wholesale index. The trade balance maintained a surplus in the first four months, with a fall of 65% in imports, due to the reduction in the quantum, and a drop of 5% in exports, reflecting depressed prices. The overall public sector deficit reached P$3.3 billion in the first four months of the year, exceeding the annual budgetary target of P$3 billion. 
The main price indices showed a divergent paths in May. The Consumer Price Index – Extended (IPCA) decreased to 0.21% in May from 0.8% in April, while the General Price Index – Domestic Supply (IGP-DI) increased to 1.12% in May from 0.7% in the previous month. The recent evolution of the price indices can be largely attributed to the behavior of food prices – with distinct trends in the wholesale and retail commerce - and to monitored prices, especially fuel prices. 
In the IPCA, food prices fell in April (0.71%) and May (0.59%), benefiting from reductions in the prices of items with relevant weight in the basic consumer basket, such as rice, beans, meat and, recently, in natura products. This behavior is explained by the seasonality in the period, by favorable agricultural harvests and by favorable climatic conditions, characterizing a favorable supply shock. The group of products with prices administered by contracts and monitored was the main reason, for the second consecutive month, for the rise in the IPCA in May, reflecting mainly the readjustments of electricity tariffs and the wages of housekeepers. 
In the past months, except for food prices, the free market prices continued to show relative stability in their monthly variation (0.48% in March, 0.52% in April and 0.46% in May). Among the main groups responsible for these variations are pharmaceuticals in March, privately owned vehicles and clothing in April, and electro electronics and services of maintenance and repair in May. 
Regarding the IGP-DI results, it is worth highlighting the evolution of the wholesale prices, which have a weighting of 60% in the general index. In this segment, it is worth mentioning the recovery, after consecutive falls since the beginning of February, in agricultural prices, which rose by 0.85% in May compared to a decline of 0.71% in April and to a reduction of 0.6% in the agricultural prices in the IGP-M of May. The main factors that explained the behavior of Agricultural Wholesale Price Index (IPA) were the prices of the soy (influenced by the variation of the exchange rate), corn (this product has a supply constraint this year, its price had already increased in the previous months), and meat in general (whose prices are now presenting a less intense decline). The wholesale prices of industrial products continued on an upward trend observed since the beginning of April. This trend reflected, in part, the depreciation of the exchange rate in the period, especially affecting the metallurgical and mechanics segments, in addition to paper and cardboard, chemical and food products. The civil construction workers’ wage readjustment scheduled in their labor agreement in three out of the eleven surveyed capitals increased the variation of the National Index of Civil Construction (INCC) by 2.5%, impacting with 0.25 p.p. in the monthly variation of the IGP-DI. The variation of the Consumer Price Index (IPC) registerd deceleration, reaching 0.28% compared to 0.71% in April, mainly due to the lower rises observed in transport and housing. 
In June, the prices administered by contracts and monitored should remain as the main source of inflationary pressure, as a result of the recent readjustments in the prices of bottled gas, urban transport tariff in Rio de Janeiro and Salvador, and fixed telephone tariffs. The contribution of the food group should be smaller, as a result of the behavior of wholesale agricultural prices. However, these movements constitute supply pressures, thus with temporary effects on the trajectory of the indices. Trend inflation Indices (core inflation indices in twelve months or free market prices excluding food) show favorable prospects. 
The last Copom decision did not cause significant shifts in the yield curve. From the beginning of June onwards, however, a significant increase was observed in the slope of the yield curve due to the deterioration in the risk perception on the part of the economic agents. The spread between the 1-year interest rate and the Over-Selic target increased to 833 bps on June 18th, from 188 bps on May 21st. The 1-month interest rate spread increased to 38 bps from -23 bps. 
In the period between May 22nd and June 18th, the National Treasury and Banco Central carried out six auctions to rollover R$ 10.0 billion in NBCE and NTN-D maturing. For the first rollover of R$ 3.7 billion in NBCE redeeming on June 13th, two NTN-D auctions were carried out at a five month tenure. For the second rollover of R$ 6.3 billion in NTN-D maturing on June 19th, four exchange rate swap auctions were carried out, one at 2-year tenure, representing 45% of the total, and the others at a 6-month tenure. 
Meanwhile, the National Treasury carried out three auctions of LTNs. In the first one, 6-month securities maturing in December 2002 were offered . In the second, which had demand for only 68% of the offers, 7-month securities maturing on January of 2003 were offered. Consequently, the National Treasury decided to reduce the tenure of the offers in the last auction of the period to four months . The total financial volume of the operations was R$ 4.3 billion, of which 84% referred to the placements of securities maturing in 2002. 
Considering the financial settlements that occurred between May 23rd and June 19th, there was an expansionary monetary impact of R$ 12.5 billion, resulting mainly from the R$ 3.7 billion net redemptions of LTN and the R$ 7.9 billion redemptions of dollar-indexed securities (mainly due to the rollover of NTN-D with exchange rate swaps). 
During the 18 working day period between May 23rd and June 19th, Banco Central do Brasil intervened in the open market by withdrawing and providing liquidity at one working day tenure and yields of 18.40% and 18.50% p.a., and average volumes of R$ 6.5 billion and R$ 0.9 billion, respectively. In the same period, Banco Central operated with daily spread auctions to level out the banking liquidity. In all operations in which Banco Central provided liquidity to the market, the yield was 18.60%. In the liquidity withdrawing interventions, the yield fell to 10% from 15%, ending the period at 18.30%. In the 18 day period, the average liquidity withdrawn and provided in the leveling operations, reached R$ 0.7 billion and R$ 0.2 billion, respectively. There were also two selling auctions of LTN with repurchase agreements, totaling R$ 3.4 billion and with an average tenure of 20 working days. 
Moreover, in June, Banco Central carried out several operations to exchange federal securities (LFT and dollar-indexed). The operations intended to reduce the duration of those securities in the market, in order to reduce the market’s exposure to these assets' price volatility. 
In the first auctions to exchange LFT, the securities repurchased were scheduled to mature in 2004, 2005 and 2006, and the ones placed will mature in 2003, totaling R$ 24.3 billion. In the other auctions, the securities offered were scheduled to mature in 2002 and the ones repurchased will mature in 2003. The nature of these operations was due to the rise in the discount of the latter securities. Banco Central accepted, on June 14 and 17, bids to exchange securities maturing in 2004 to 2006, amounting R$ 5.1 billion. The bids for LFT maturing in 2003 reached R$ 14.4 billion, on June 17 and 18. 
In the three auctions to exchange dollar-indexed securities, the repurchased securities were scheduled to mature in 2004 and 2005. In the first two, securities maturing in 2003 were sold (totaling R$ 4.0 billion), and, in the last one, Banco Central sold securities maturing in 2002 (amounting to R$ 3.0 billion). 
Three auctions to exchange FX swaps were carried out in order to reduce the duration and distortions in the slope of the exchange rate coupon. In the first two, the contracts accepted were scheduled to mature in 2004 and the ones placed will mature in 2003. The notional value of the operations reached USS 1.7 billion. In the third operation, Banco Central assumed a long position in contracts maturing in 2003 and 2007 and a short position in contracts maturing in 2004. The notional value of the operation was USS 1.9 billion. 
In May, the domestic federal securitized debt increased by R$ 6.1 billion compared to the previous month. The increase in the share of the exchange rate indexed debt to 30.3% in May from 28.8% in April was mainly due to the depreciation of the Real. 
The identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed in the light of the newly available information. The scenario considered in the simulations assumes the following hypotheses: 
May inflation rate, measured by the IPCA, declined in relation to April, reaching 0.21% in May, compared to 0.80% in the previous month, 
For 2002 as a whole, a 4.5% decline in gasoline prices is forecast due to the fall in January and February. This forecast is higher than the –6.6% forecast in the last Copom meeting. For bottled gas, a 28.0% increase is forecast for 2002 (compared to an increase of around 29% in the last meeting), of which 21.5pp has already occurred from January to May. The increase in the forecasts of these products was partially offset by a smaller than expected readjustment of these products in the May IPCA, 
The average increase of electricity tariffs in 2002 is estimated at 19.4%, compared to 18.0% forecast in May. For 2003, the forecast for the readjustment of electricity tariffs declined to 12.3% from 13.6% forecast in May, 
Regarding the set of prices administered by contracts and monitored, with a weighting of 30.8% in the IPCA, the inflation forecast for 2002 is 8.1% compared to 7.6% forecast in the May Copom meeting. The increase in the forecast was basically due to the exchange rate depreciation that occurred between the Copom meetings of May and June. This depreciation was partially offset by the evolution of the international price of petroleum and its by-products. The gasoline price in the United States, which is used by Petrobras as a parameter, has declined. Likewise, the future prices of gasoline and propane gas have declined compared to the Copom meeting of May. The forecast inflation for the prices administered by contracts and monitored is 6.1% for 2003. There was thus an increase of 1.6 p.p. since the May Copom meeting. The increase in the inflation forecast for 2003 is due to the effects of the exchange rate depreciation, to the increase in the future price of petroleum by-products next year, and to the change in the hypothesis of price readjustments for specific items, 
The inflation forecasts were based on the new specification of the structural models that has the 180-days pre-fixed DI swap as its explanatory variable, replacing both the Selic rate and the slope of the term structure of the interest rate. The forecast of the 6-month spread over the Selic rate is based on a model specification that is based on the new method of estimating by error correction. Maintaining the Selic rate constant, the 6-month spread forecast starts at 350 b.p. on the third quarter of 2002, presenting a declining trend afterwards to reach 50 b.p. during 2003. 
The trend of the U.S. Fed Funds rate, based on the maturities of the future contracts, was changed to reflect a 1.75% average rate in the second quarter of 2002, increasing to 2.25% in the first quarter of 2003, and stabilizing at 2.5% from the second quarter of 2003 onwards. 
The sovereign risk premium, based on the spread over treasury of Brazil’s Global 08, is forecast to decline gradually to 700 b.p. in 2003 from the average plateau of 940 b.p. in this quarter. On the eve of the Copom meeting, it reached around 1,500 b.p. 
The core inflation of the IPCA, calculated under the symmetric trimmed-mean method, declined to 0.51% in May from 0.56% in April. In the last 12 months, this core figure registered a 7.58% variation. The IPC-BR core inflation, calculated under the symmetric trimmed-mean method, declined to 0.36% in May from 0.46% in April. In the last 12 months, this core figure registered a 7.10% variation. Core inflation calculated by excluding prices administered by contracts and monitored plus household food prices registered a 0.46% variation in May, accumulating 6.39% in 12 months. 
The accumulated variation of the IPCA in 12 months was 7.77% in May, below the rate observed in April (7.98%) and close to the rate observed in March (7.75%). The free market prices contributed with 4.05p.p. to inflation and the prices administered by contracts and monitored contributed with 3.72p.p. The inflation expectations surveyed by Banco Central do Brasil's Investor Relations Group (GCI) remained stable for 2002 and 2003, respectively at 5.46% and 4.00%. 
Regarding the fiscal policy, the hypothesis assumed is to achieve the primary surplus target of 3.75% for the consolidated public sector. The remaining assumptions established in the previous meeting were maintained. 
From the simulation exercises with several specifications of the structural model, it has been concluded that the maintenance of the interest rate at 18.5%p.a. and the exchange rate at the same plateau as on the eve of the Copom meeting will lead to an inflation rate of approximately 5.5% in 2002 and below the target in 2003. 
The indicators of economic activity on the second quarter of 2002 seem to confirm that the economy is recovering from the low level of growth observed last year, albeit at a slower pace. In the first quarter of 2002, seasonally adjusted GDP grew by 1.34% compared to the previous quarter. The strong seasonally adjusted growth in the industrial production in April (4.07%), measured by the IBGE, was partially influenced by the anticipation of the seasonal bank holidays. In line with the growth in industrial production was the increase in the real payroll in April, both in São Paulo, according to FIESP, and throughout Brazil, according to the CNI. 
For the month of May, some indicators point to a reduction in industrial production compared to the previous month. The inventory levels in the manufacturing industry of raw materials and intermediate goods declined according to CNI estimates, whilst inventories of final goods increased in the first quarter. The open unemployment rate, measured by the IBGE, interrupted the downward trajectory and started to rise again, reaching 7.6% in April, compared to 7.1% in March. The Consumer Intentions Index, measured by São Paulo's Fecomércio, significantly declined by 12.31% in June (seasonally adjusted). Likewise, the Industrial Entrepreneur Confidence Index fell slightly in the current quarter, albeit rising significantly in the first quarter of the year compared to the two previous quarters. Credit to consumers and corporations should be relatively constant in the following months due to the increase in default rates, constraining expenditures with consumption and investments. 
The performance of the external sector continues to be positive. The trade balance showed a positive result of US$ 4.9 billion in the last twelve months up to May. The current account deficit accumulated in 12 months has continuously declined since August 2001, reaching US$ 19.4 billion in April. From January to May 2002, this deficit was fully financed by the net inflows of foreign direct investment, which totaled US$ 22.4 billion accumulated in the last 12 months. For 2002, the deficit is projected to reach US$ 19 billion, and should be almost entirely financed by the US$ 18 billion net inflow of foreign direct investment. 
Nonetheless, the recent adverse economic scenario, marked by an increase in the uncertainties regarding the future of the country, has negatively influenced the price of local and foreign assets. Comparing the exchange rates quoted on the days immediately preceding the Copom meetings, the Real has depreciated by 7.5% since the meeting in May, with the country risk measured by the Embi+ rising to a level above 1,300 bps from 930 bps. The volatility in the markets also hit other assets. The one-year exchange rate coupon significantly increased in comparison with that observed at the beginning of the year, the same occurring with the discounts on the long term LFTs. 
The IPCA inflation in May was 0.21%, 0.59 p.p. below April inflation. The prices administered by contracts and monitored increased by 0.43%, influenced by the readjustments in the prices of oil by-products. Free market prices increased by 0.11%, benefiting from the seasonal behavior of food prices. The variation of the free market prices has declined since February 2002, reaching 0.64%. Excluding the impact of in natura food prices, free market prices increased by 0.17% in May. 
For the months of June and July, a higher increase is expected in free market prices compared to those registered in May. The reversal in the decline of agricultural prices is already impacting on wholesale prices, with the agricultural IPA increasing by 0.85% in May. Moreover, the recent exchange rate depreciation should exert pressures on free market prices in the following months. Nonetheless, this impact may be limited. Firstly, as a result of slower economic growth, the capacity of firms to passthrough the cost increases associated with the exchange rate variation is limited. Furthermore, during the first four months of the year, for the establishment of prices, in all likelihood, a more depreciated exchange rate than effectively occurred was being used as a parameter. Likewise, the economic agents may also be establishing prices based on an exchange rate that is more appreciated than is effectively occurring. 
Prices administered by contracts and monitored should also exert pressures on inflation in June and July. Petrobras announced a 9.2% readjustment in the refinery prices of bottled gas, effective from June 1st. In that period, there will also be a concentration of readjustments in the prices of electricity and fixed-line telephones. 
The impact of the exchange rate variation on prices administered by contracts and monitored is more direct than on free market prices. In the case of prices of oil by-products, the domestic prices closely follow international prices converted into Reais, though the percentage readjustment to consumers would be lower due to the existence of other cost elements and the disproportion between taxes and prices. In the case of electricity and fixed-line telephones, the contracts signed with the concessionaires usually embed readjustments based on the exchange rate variation and/or on the IGP variation, which is influenced by the exchange rate. 
The shock of prices administered by contracts and monitored is defined as the value that exceeds the inflation target, after deducting the impact of the exchange rate passthrough and the inertia on these prices. As the exchange rate depreciated, the impact of its passthrough on the prices administered by contracts and monitored increased. However, the projection for the inflation of prices administered by contracts and monitored was lower than that predicted by the passthrough coefficient, mainly due to the drop of international prices of oil by-products. Thus, the primary effect of the shock of prices administered by contracts and monitored declined to around 0.5 p.p. On the other hand, the forecast for the impact of 2001 inertia on 2002 inflation increased to 0.9 p.p. from 0.7 p.p. due to the incorporation of the chain effect through 2002, as detailed in the Technical Note n. 22 (“Methodology for calculating the inflation inertia and the effects of the shock to administered prices”). The inflation target for 2002 adjusted for the impact of the primary effects of the shocks of prices administered by contracts and for part of the impact of the 2001 inertia on the 2002 inflation is between 4.5% and 5%. 
The inflation expectations surveyed by the Banco Central do Brasil's Investor Relations Group (GCI) are still indicating a decline in inflation for the near future. For 2002 and 2003, the expectations are converging to a figure below 5.5% and around 4.0%, respectively. 
Copom has worked with a basic scenario for the following 18 months that assumes both the maintenance of an economic policy in 2003 that is committed to fiscal stability and the inflation target regime and a transition to the future government without exaggerated and/or prolonged moments of turbulence. 
In this basic scenario, the inflation of free market prices should maintain its downward trend and the inflation measured by IPCA should be in accordance with the targets established by the government. According to the models used by the Central Bank, the projection of the variation of IPCA for 2002 increased since the May meeting and is around 5.5%. The revision was due exclusively to the exchange rate depreciation in the period. The projection for the IPCA in 2003 is below the established target of 3.25%. 
In this scenario, the Copom understands that it would be advisable to reduce the interest rate due to the following factors: (i) in the current monetary conditions, the projection of inflation for 2003 is significantly below the target, (ii) the inflation expectations show confidence prevailing to a downward trend for inflation in the following 18 months, and (iii) despite the projection for inflation in 2002 being slightly over the center of the target adjusted by the impact of the shocks of prices administered by contracts and monitored and in part due to the impact of the inflationary inertia of 2001 on 2002 inflation (resulting in an interval between 4.5% and 5.0%), this difference reflects the recent increase of the market's volatility, especially in relation to the exchange rate, which tends to be a temporary factor. 
However, one should evaluate the risk of the non-materialization of this basic scenario. As uncertainty in relation to the future of the country’s economy and the recent adverse conjuncture, characterized by the steep depreciation of asset prices and of the exchange rate persist, the risk of an increase in the projections for inflation in 2002 and 2003 also exists. Especially, the perception of a temporary exchange rate variation and the magnitude of its passthrough to prices could be brought into question, in spite of the factors that could restrain the exchange rate passthrough described above. 
Weighing up all the options, Copom considered that, although the prospects for inflation are favorable in the baseline scenario, the increase of the uncertainties regarding the economic scenario place doubts on the materialization of this scenario and recommends the maintenance of the present interest rate. However, as the financial market normalizes, with the stabilization of asset prices and of the exchange rate at levels that reflect more adequately the economic fundamentals, the prospect of declining inflation in the following 18 months will become more likely, and may in turn permit a reduction in the interest rate. As a result, taking into account that the recent instability does not reflect the current fundamentals of the Brazilian economy and thus can be considered as temporary, the Copom assessed that the situation recommends signaling of a possible reduction in the interest rate before the meeting in July
"
27/07/2002;73;Arminio Fraga;"The economic activity has been showing deceleration in the last few months, as a consequence of the recent instability and its impact on the aggregated demand. Some indicators show that the favorable results of industry and commerce, observed in previous months, were associated with circumstantial facts such as the statistical effect of the Easter holidays in March, and events like the Mother's Day and the World Cup. Recent information indicates relative economic stability, due to the modest growth of payroll and of credit demand. Further circumstantial factors, such as the payment of the balances of Time in Service Guarantee Fund (FGTS), in a context of financial uncertainty, may marginally affect the evolution of the activity level indicators in the following months. 
Industrial production fell by 5.1% in May (seasonally adjusted data), due to the 6.4% reduction in the manufacturing industry, compensated in part by the 2.8% growth in the mining industry. The contraction of production of manufacture in the month was predictable - as the result was partly due to the statistical effect compared with the steep growth registered in April - albeit the decline was sharper than expected. All the categories of use showed decline, especially the durable consumer goods (-12.9%) and capital goods (-9.7%). Regarding the performance of the industrial sectors surveyed, one can observe that most sectors registered declines (16 out of the 22), especially electrical material and communications (-8.9%), mechanical (-8.8%), transport material (-7.6%), food products (-5.7%) and metallurgical (-4.6%). Indicators related to the production of corrugated paper and machinery for agricultural activities registered another fall in industrial production in June, however far less steeper than the one observed in May. 
The Continuous Survey of Agricultural Production, carried out by IBGE in May, continued to indicate an increase in the total grain production between 2001 and 2002, however lower than the one registered last month. Total grain production would reach 98.8 million tons in 2002, representing 0.3% increase in relation to 2001. Besides grain production, other important farming products should show higher production levels, such as sugar cane (4.5%), oranges (10.2%) and coffee (12.4%). 
In the last months, demand indicators have been showing an unstable behavior with no defined trend. The real turnover of the retail commerce in São Paulo's Metropolitan Region decreased by 2.1% in June (seasonally adjusted data), maintaining the pattern of ups and downs throughout the year, according to data from the São Paulo State's Federation of Commerce (Fecomércio). The analysis by segments shows that the automobile commerce and the non-durable goods sales maintained a favorable performance during the month, growing 1.3% and 0.9%, respectively. The environment of economic instability apparent in June contributed to the negative performance of the remaining segments. 
According to the São Paulo Trade Association (ACSP), the enquiries to the Credit Protection Service (SPC) and to the Usecheque expanded 1.5% in June, in relation to May (seasonally adjusted series). However, according to the same institution, the default rate rose to 8.3% in June from 7% in May (seasonally adjusted data). 
The Index of Consumer Intentions (IIC), released by Fecomércio, registered steep recovery (12.8%), according to seasonally adjusted data, after two consecutive months of decline. The fact that Brazil won the World Cup together with the payment of the balances of the FGTS reflected positively on consumer expectations in July. Both actual and future intentions registered growth in their indexes. 
The demand for credit remains retracted, influenced by the economic instability observed in the last few months, while the financial institutions continue to be selective with their lending policies. Nevertheless, in June, there was an expansion of 2.4% in bank credit stock - that reached R$ 351.8 billion - basically due to the accounting effect of the exchange rate depreciation over the portfolios funded by external resources and the incentive to operations using the Advance on Export Contracts (ACC). 
Among the operations with freely allocated resources, responsible for 59% of the total balance, the stock of credit to companies increased 4.2% in June, totaling R$ 130.5 billion. This expansion was concentrated, for the second consecutive month, in modalities contracted with foreign resources, which increased by 8.5% in the month. Noteworthy are the expansions of 8.7% in the balance of loans with external funding and 8.2% of the ACC operations. The stock of credit contracted by private individuals remained practically stable at R$ 76.5 billion, with a variation of 0.1% in the month. 
The banking spread of prefixed credit operations reached 37.1 pp, the smallest value in the last 12 months, mainly due to the increase in the medium and long term funding cost and to the stability of lending rates. This stability resulted from a 0.7 pp decline of credit to companies, especially short term operations, in relation to May, while the credit to private individuals increased 0.4 pp, as several credit lines to individuals increased, especially credit to finance automobile purchases. The credit operations default with freely allocated resources declined by 0.4 pp, reaching 8.5%. The default levels on credit operations with freely allocated resources declined by 0.4 p.p., reaching 8.5%. This performance is a result of debt renegotiation, mainly related to personal credit lines, lent by large financial institutions. 
In the labor market, the average rate of unemployment, measured by IBGE, remained almost stable in May, 7.7% compared to 7.6% in April. However, both the employed workers, according to IBGE, and the formal employment, according to the Ministry of Labor and Employment, maintained an upward trend in May. The seasonally adjusted series of formal employment showed an increase of 0.2% in May, while the number of employed workers, according to the Monthly Employment Survey carried out by IBGE, increased 0.5% in the same period. 
Regarding the external transactions of the Brazilian economy, the trade balance accumulated a US$ 2.6 billion surplus in the first semester, in comparison to the US$ 72 million deficit registered in the same period of 2001. This result was caused by a 22.6% reduction in imports, mainly of raw materials and capital goods, motivated by the gradual and continuous import substitution, by the drop of exports of manufactured goods, by the slower pace of industrial production and by the reshaping of investment projects. Exports dropped by 13.4% in the first semester as a result of the decline in exports to Argentina. In the first two weeks of July, the trade surplus reached US$ 764 million, due to the sharp increase in exports of basic and semi-manufactured goods. Daily average of exports, which were showing successive drops in the previous months, registered a 28.5% growth in the first fifteen days of July, in comparison to the same period in 2001, while the imports registered a decline of 3.3%. The result of July is in part a consequence of the normalization of shipments after the delays of May and June, due to the strike of the customs authorities.
The improvement in the trade balance has contributed to the reduction in the current account deficit that is taking place simultaneously with the reduction of the resources available to finance the balance of payments, mainly the issuance of securities abroad and long term foreign loans. In June, the current account deficit reached US$ 1.3 billion, in comparison to the US$ 2.1 billion in the same month of 2001, totally financed by the US$ 1.6 billion inflow of foreign direct investment. 
In summary, the second quarter was a period of downturn in economic activity from the recovery initiated at the end of 2001, especially towards the end of the period due to deteriorating expectations. The deterioration of the environment of uncertainties due to the elections in October and unfavorable events in the international scenario have influenced the decisions of the economic agents who have postponed expenditure on consumption and investment. 
The uncertainty in capital markets, caused by the accounting frauds, is causing an increase of risk aversion by investors and reducing international liquidity. This fact has asymmetrically impacted on emerging market countries, especially those with largest balance of payments borrowing requirement. This scenario worsened by the lack of recovery in economic activity of developed countries and to the decline in international trade. 
In the United States, the scenario of a possible economic recovery continues to be undefined. In the last revision, real GDP grew 6.1% p.a. in the first trimester of 2002. In May, personal consumption expenditures remained stable for the third consecutive month. The sales of industry and commerce declined 0.4% in May, with inventories showing a variation of 0.2%. The inventory-to-sales ratio reached 1.36, slightly superior to the previous level. Retail sales increased by 1.1% in June, above market expectations. In spite of the 0.14% growth, in June, producer price index declined by 2.04% in the year. The core index registered 0.2% in the month, accumulating 0.27% in the year. The entrepreneurs confidence indicators, surveyed by the Institute for Supply Management, stayed positive, however, showing some variations - PMI-manufacture ratio rose to 56.2% in June from 55.7% in May, while BAI-Services ratio declined to 57.2% from 60.1%, in the same period. The latest forecasts of the index of consumer confidence have shown retraction. The index measured by the Conference Board fell to 106.4 in June, while that measured by the University of Michigan declined to 86.5 in July, the lowest level since November 2001. The trade quantum continued retracting in April and the trade deficit registered slight growth, due to the reduction in exports. In the first quarter, the current account deficit increased and the net financial flow declined. 
The expectations regarding the behavior of the Japanese economy improved with more optimism over the prospects of the future recovery in the levels of economic activity. Retail sales have not reacted yet, with the growth rate staying stable at 0.1%, over the 12 months, up to April. However, factory orders increased by 2.5%, in May, compared to April, increasing for the third time in the year. Industrial production, in May, expanded by 4.1%, reflecting gains of electrical machinery and of the transport equipment sectors. The confidence index Tankan which expresses the expectations of the larger entrepreneurs, reached -18 points in the second trimester, in comparison to -38 points in the previous period, the first positive variation since the second quarter of 2000. The trade balance reverted its downward trend, in spite of the appreciation of the yen. The performance of trade balance in May was mainly due to the decline in imports. Exports totaled US$ 36.6 billion in May, a 6.9% increase in relation to May 2001, while imports fell 8.2%, in the same period, reaching US$ 29.3 billion. 
In the Euro Area, the domestic demand remained depressed, with a 0.1% growth in retail sales, in 12 the months up to April. The rate of unemployment remained stable at 8.3%. Regarding inflation, the annual variation of the Consumer Price Index - Harmonized declined to 2% in May, from 2.4% in April. In addition, the producer price index registered a higher deflation of 0.9%, in comparison to the deflation of 0.7% in April. The evolution of the main confidence indicators show a reversion in the recovery trend of the expectations of entrepreneurs and consumers. In spite of the euro appreciation, the trade balance accumulated in 12 months continues to grow, although export sales are growing at a slower rate.
In Argentina, the economic activity continues to slowdown, although some demand indicators have increased in May, in relation to April, such as supermarket sales (4.7%), shopping center sales (7.1%) and civil construction (2.5%). Industrial production in May declined by 13.5% in relation to May 2001 and increased by 0.9% in relation to the previous month. Preliminary data shows that 23% of the Economically Active Population is unemployed and 22% are sub-employed. The recession and the demand contraction have been responsible for the restraints on prices, resulting in the decline in inflation in the last two months. The trade balance registered a US$ 6.6 billion surplus in the first five months of the year, in comparison to a US$ 1.1 billion surplus in the same period of last year. The result reflects contractions of 6% in exports and 64% in imports. 
The main price indices registered increases of inflation in June compared to May, reflecting the rise in food prices, the impact of exchange rate depreciation, mainly in the wholesale prices, and the readjustments of the administered and monitored prices in the period. The IPCA increased by 0.42% in comparison to 0.21% in May, and the IGP-DI increased by 1.74%, in comparison to 1.11% in May. 
Amongst the items that most pressured the IPCA in June, noteworthy are the increase in bottled gas (9.02%), urban bus fares (2.44%) and clothing (1.39%) - due to the launch of the Autumn/Winter collection. It is important to stress that the free prices maintained relative stability in the month varying 0.12% in June and 0.11% in May, contributing to the maintenance of the IPCA close to the threshold of the market expectations interval, in June. 
Regarding the IGP-DI results, the evolution of the wholesale prices, mainly the agricultural prices should be highlighted. The Agricultural Wholesale Price Index showed a 4.57% rise, reinforcing the recovery of prices initiated in May, when the index showed a 0.85% variation. It is worth mentioning that the agricultural prices reflect, to a large extent, the recent behavior of the exchange rate – much of the impacts observed in the month came from items whose prices were highly influenced by the exchange rate, such as soy, wheat and soy bean oil. The wholesale industrial prices registered rises of 1.74% in June, compared to 1.42% in May, reflecting, among others, the exchange rate depreciation. The Consumer Price index (IPC) did not follow, to the same extent, the increase in the wholesale prices, reaching 0.55% in June, compared to 0.28% in May. 
For July, a larger impact of administered by contracts and monitored prices is expected on the inflation indices, due to the concentration of readjustments of public services tariffs in the period, namely, electricity (in São Paulo and Curitiba) and fixed-line telephone (in the whole country), and the readjustments of fuel prices at the beginning of the month. This factor should increase the rates of consumer price indices in July, when the highest inflation of the year may be registered. However, free prices should go on showing favorable behavior, going slightly above the level registered in June, due to the recovery of food prices. 
It is worth highlighting that from August onwards the administered by contracts and monitored prices tend to show expressively smaller variations, since the main readjustments expected for the year have already occurred. Moreover, the effects of exchange rate depreciation over the prices – although meaningful for the wholesale prices – mainly due to the absence of items of services and by the presence of commodities in their composition - tend to be significantly smaller compared to the consumer prices indices, mainly due to the limited growth of the activity level. 
The deterioration in the risk perception and the movement of some market participants that unwound contracted positions in the interest rate future market, contributed to the interest rate yield curve reaching the highest level of slope within the period, and the spread between the 1-year rate and Selic rate target reaching 1280 b.p., on June 21st. After that, there was a gradual reduction of interest rate practiced in the interest rate futures market. On July 16th, the spread between the 1-year rate and the Selic target rate reached 878 b.p, compared to 833 b.p. on June 18th.
In the period between June 19th and July 16th, the Banco Central do Brasil (BCB) carried out three auctions to rollover the NBCEs. Exchange rate swap auctions were carried out in two stages in order to rollover R$ 5.5 billion maturing on July 11th. In the first, the value corresponded to R$ 2.8 billion, and contracts were offered with maturity in 2005, 2007 and 2008, in the second rollover, amounting to R$ 2.7 billion, contracts were placed for redemption in 2 and 7 months. Regarding the R$ 2.9 billion rollover of NBCE maturing on July 18th, only the equivalent of R$ 1.2 billion in Fx swap contracts were auctioned, with maturity in 2, 7 and 17 months. The partial rollover was due to the weak demand observed. 
At the same time, the National Treasury auctioned on three occasions, LTN and LFT maturing in September 2002, limiting the total offer to 500 thousand securities per auction. The financial volume was R$ 1.6 billion, of which R$ 1,2 billion in LTN. 
Considering the financial settlements between June 20th and July 16th, there was an expansionary monetary impact of R$ 14.2 billion, resulting mainly from the net redemptions of LTN and dollar-indexed securities. 
During the 19 working day period between June 20th and July 16th, the BCB intervened in the open market by withdrawing and providing liquidity at one working day tenure and yields of 18.40% and 18.50% p.a., and average volumes of R$ 10.5 billion and R$ 2.1 billion, respectively. The BCB also carried out an auction of LTN with a repurchase agreement totaling R$ 0.6 billion with tenure of 29 working days. 
Moreover, Banco Central carried out three operations to exchange LFT. The operations intended to reduce the duration of the securities in the market in order to reduce the market’s exposure to the volatility of these assets’ price. R$ 3.0 billion in LFT was exchanged maturing in 2003 for LFT maturing in 2002. 
The BCB carried out two auctions of exchange Fx swap aiming at reducing distortions in the slope of the Fx coupon and at reducing the average tenure. In the first, the BCB assumed short position in contracts maturing in July 2003, amounting to US$ 1.1 billion and assumed a long position in contracts maturing in January 2003 and January 2005, to the sum of US$ 0,8 billion e US$ 0,3 billion, respectively. In the second, assumed long position in contracts maturing in October 2002, amounting to US$ 1.5 billion and a short position maturing in April and July 2003, of US$ 0.5 and US$ 1.0 billion, respectively. 
The BCB and the National Treasury carried out on July 12th a joint operation to exchange NBCE by LFT with Fx swap. The selling auction of LFT by National Treasury amounted to R$ 9.9 billion, a sum equivalent to the NBCE purchased by the BCB. The operation intended to generate less volatility to the quotas of investment funds that were the holders of securities and Fx swaps (due to the asymmetric evolution of the Fx coupom slopes of the two instruments) and the decline in the volume of the collateral maintained in the BM&F. 
In June, the domestic federal securitized debt increased by R$ 14.4 billion (2.3%). The increase in the share of the exchange rate indexed debt by R$ 23.4 billion was due to the depreciation of the Real of 12.8% occurred in June. 
The identified shocks and their impact were reassessed in the light of newly available information. The scenario considered in the simulation considers the followings assumptions: 
1. The inflation rate in June, measured by the IPCA, reached 0.42%, in comparison to 0.21% observed in May, 
2. For 2002 as a whole, a reduction of 2% is forecast for gasoline prices due to the fall in January and February, a lower reduction than the projected in the last Copom meeting (-4.5%). For bottled gas, a 42% increase is forecasted for 2002, of which 32% has already occurred from January to June. In the Copom meeting of June 2002 an increase close to 28% was projected, characterizing a substantial increase in the forecasts. 
3. Regarding electricity tariffs, an increase of 19.2% for 2002 is projected, compared to a 19.4% forecast in June. For 2003, the forecast for the readjustment of electricity tariffs increased to 14.4% in July from 12.3% in June, due to exchange rate depreciation and the expected increase of inflation for 2003, 
4. Regarding the set of prices administered by contracts and monitored, with a weighting of 30.8% in the IPCA, the inflation forecast for 2002 is 8.9%, compared to 8.1% forecasted in the Copom meeting of June. The increase in the forecast was basically due to the exchange rate depreciation that occurred between the Copom meetings of June and July. For 2003, the inflation forecast for the prices administered by contracts and monitored is 6.6%. There was thus an increase of 0.5 p.p. since the Copom Meeting of June. The increase in the inflation forecast for 2003 is also due to the effects of the exchange rate depreciation, besides the increase of expected inflation for 2003, which is used in forecasts of some specific items as water and sewage tax, electricity and fixed-line telephones. 
5. The projection of the 6-months spread over the Selic rate, applying a specification based on a error correction estimation model and maintaining constant the Selic rate at 18.5%p.a., starts from 460 b.p. at the third quarter of 2002, declining to –80 b.p. in the last quarter of 2003, 
6. The path of the U.S. Fed Funds rate, based on the futures contracts maturities, was revised to reflect a 1.75% rate at the third and fourth quarters of 2002, increasing to 1.8% in the first quarter of 2003 and remaining unchanged at 2.0% after the second quarter of 2003,
7. The sovereign risk premium, based on the spread over treasury of Brazil’s Global 08, is forecasted to decline gradually to 700 b.p. in 2003 from the average plateau of 1.800 b.p. in this quarter, 
The core inflation of the IPCA, calculated under the symmetric trimmed-mean method, declined to 0.40% in June from 0.51% in May. In the last 12 months, this core registered a 7.23% variation. In its turn, the IPC-BR core inflation, calculated under the symmetric trimmed-mean method, increased to 0.41% in June from 0.36% in May. In the last 12 months, this core registered a 6.94% variation. Core inflation calculated by excluding the prices administered by contracts and monitored plus household food prices registered a 0.13% variation in June, accumulating 6.22% in the 12 months. 
The accumulated variation of the IPCA in 12 months registered 7.66% in June, below the rate observed in May (7.77%) and in April (7.98%). The free market prices contributed with 4.02p.p. to inflation and the prices administered by contracts and monitored with 3.65 p.p.. The inflation expectations surveyed by the BCB’s Investor Relations Group (Gerin) for 2002 and 2003, increased to 5.8% and 4.2% respectively. 
Regarding the fiscal policy, the hypothesis assumed is to achieve the primary surplus of 3.75% for the consolidated public sector. All the others assumptions considered in the previous meeting were maintained. 
From the simulation exercises with several specifications of the structural model, it has been concluded that the maintenance of the interest rate at 18.5% p.a. and the exchange rate at the same plateau as on the eve of the Copom meeting indicates an inflation rate slightly over 5.5% in 2002 and well below the target in 2003
The economic activity has lost dynamism in the last few months, reflecting the recent instability and its impact on aggregate demand. Most of the data related to industry showed decrease in May in comparison to April, in the seasonally adjusted series. According to the IBGE, production declined by 5.1% and, in accordance to the CNI, there was a decline in employment (0.1%), in hours worked in production (4.1%), in the payroll (0.6%) and in the utilization of installed capacity (1.2%). Preliminary indicators, such as the reduction of shipments of corrugated paper and in the production of agricultural machinery, indicate a new decline of industrial production in June. There is also a prospect of fall in the Industrial Entrepreneur Confidence Index. 
In spite of the negative results of the industrial sector, there are factors that have softened the deceleration of the activity level. Agricultural production in 2002 should be higher than in 2001, with some items growing more than 10%, like soy, wheat, coffee and oranges. Besides, demand has been sustained by the increase of agricultural income, the liberation of balances of the Time in Service Guarantee Fund (FGTS) and the social programs expenditures. The Consumer Intentions Index increased by almost 10 p.p. between June and July, although this figure only partially offsets the 12 p.p. fall registered between May and June. 
The interest rates set by the market showed an considerable increase in the last two months, constraining the activity level. The 6-month fixed interest rate swap increased to 23.0% from 18.5% between the meetings of May and July, and the 12-month fixed interest rate swap reached 26.4% from 20.2%. It is understood that the aggregate demand is not a factor of inflationary pressure in the economy. 
The foreign sector has registered positive results in the last twelve months. The trade balance shows a US$ 5.3 billion surplus in the twelve months up to June, which represents an increase of approximately US$ 0.4 billion since May. The current account deficit, in the twelve months result, has continuously declined since August 2001 and reached US$ 18.2 billion in June. This deficit was entirely financed by the net inflows of foreign direct investment, which reached US$ 22.2 billion in the twelve months up to June. 
However, the adverse situation observed since mid-April, characterized by an increase of the uncertainty in relation to the future of the country and, aggravated, in the last month, by the increase of the risk perception in relation to the world economy, has negatively influenced the asset prices denominated in foreign and local currencies. The risk measured by the Embi+ reached 1572 b.p. and the thirty-day volatility of the exchange rate increased by 20.3%, despite the fall to 12.8% of the five-day volatility. The volatility of the markets also affected other assets. The one-year FX coupon reached 16.6%. 
The inflation measured by the IPCA was 0.42% in June, above the 0.21% registered in May, due to the behavior of administered by contracts and monitored prices, which increased 1,09% in June. The inflation of these prices was pressured mainly by the readjustments of bottled gas (9.02% in June and 32.4% year-to-date) and urban bus fares in Salvador and Rio de Janeiro (10.0% and 9.09%, respectively). The prices administered by contracts and monitored should also impact significantly on inflation in July. In this respect it is worth highlighting the readjustments of 6.75% and 6.2% for gasoline and bottled gas in the refineries, the 8.07% average increase in the tariffs of fixed-line telephones and the 14.24% and 10.96% increase in electricity tariffs in São Paulo and Curitiba. 
Recent data confirm the declining inflation of free market prices in the economy. After reaching a 0.64% variation in February, the inflation of free market prices declined to 0.45%, 0.24%, 0.11% and 0.12% in the following months. It should be emphasized that, unlike in May, inflation in June was not benefited by the harvest season. When household food items are excluded from the free market prices, corresponding to core inflation measured with the exclusion of administered by contracts and monitored prices and of household food items, inflation declines to 0.13% in June, from 0.46% in May. The variation of the core inflation measured by the symmetric trimmed-mean method also decreased, reaching 0.40% in June from 0.51% in May.
The shock of administered by contracts and monitored prices declined to a figure close to 0.35 p.p., as the projection for the inflation of administered by contracts and monitored prices was smaller than that forecasted by the pass-through coefficient, as occurred in June. The projection for the 2002 inflation is above the center of the target adjusted by the impact of the shock of administered by contracts and monitored prices and by the impact of part of the inflationary inertia of 2001 in 2002, resulting in the 4.0%-4.5% interval for the adjusted target. However, the difference between the projection for 2002 and this interval reflects the recent depreciation of the exchange rate, which tends to be temporary (at least partially) and, due to its magnitude, recommends a more gradual correction of its inflationary effects. 
The inflation expectations surveyed by the Investor Relations Group (Gerin) of the BCB increased since the Copom’s meeting of June. For 2002, the expectations changed to 5,8% from around 5,5%, probably due to the depreciation of the exchange rate observed in the period. For 2003, the inflation expectations were revised in 0.2 p.p., rising to 4.2% from 4.0%. 
The inflation caused by free market prices may rise in the coming months due to the pass-through of the exchange rate depreciation to prices. However, this impact may be limited, as firms may have difficulties to pass-through the increase in costs linked to the exchange rate variation, due to the slower pace of economic growth. 
The exchange rate depreciation and the increases in the several risk premiums in the markets are due to the uncertainties in relation to the international scenario and the future macroeconomic policy in Brazil. This combination of the increase in risk aversion by enterprises and global banks and the perception of fragility in Brazil requires a response that is beyond monetary policy. 
The Copom has worked with a basic scenario for the next 18 months that assumes the maintenance of an economic policy in 2003 committed to the fiscal and monetary responsibility and to the fulfillment of contractual obligations. These policies are not related to ideologies or political parties, and represent an essential condition to ensure economic security, growth and development. It is therefore reasonable that one awaits their maintenance in the next administration, which has been indicated by the main Presidential candidates. This commitment may make possible, if necessary, stronger financial support from the international community. 
In this basic scenario, the decreasing trend of the inflation of free market prices observed in this year should continue through the following eighteen-month period. For 2003, the basic scenario forecasts inflation significantly below than the new target of 4%. In addition, the change of the target for 2003 and the definition of 3.75% as the target for 2004 offer more leeway to accommodate fortuitous upward revisions of the projections, if alternative scenarios are confirmed. Consequently, the members of the Copom agreed that there is room for a loosening of the monetary policy. 
However, there was no consensus about the adequate timing for the returning to the process of reducing the basic interest rate. Five members considered that the forecast of inflation for 2003 significantly below the target and the confidence in the maintenance, in the future, of a responsible macroeconomic framework, recommend immediate reduction of the current basic interest rate. Two members of the Copom considered, however, that, as the turbulence in the financial market causes uncertainties on the inflation projections, recommend the loosening of the monetary policy when the situation in the financial market stabilizes, voting for the maintenance of the interest rate with a downward bias.  
"
30/08/2002;74;Arminio Fraga;" Recently released indicators confirmed the loss of dynamism of economic activity - signaled after May - due to the adverse conditions in the financial markets and as a result of uncertainties created by the Presidential elections campaign. Such factors reflected significantly on consumer and business expectations, with impact on expenses, mainly those related to goods of relatively higher value. In spite of that, the FGTS (Time in Service Guarantee Fund) disbursements and significant improvement of the agricultural income this year, amongst others, supported the level of consumption, mainly of non-durable or durable goods of low value. 
Preliminary figures released by São Paulo State’s Federation of Commerce (Fecomércio-SP) showed a 3.5% increase in real turnover of retail commerce, seasonally adjusted data, in the metropolitan region of São Paulo in July. This performance is due particularly to the increase in sales of goods with lower unitary value. Sales of non-durable consumer goods increased by 3.4%, of semi-durable 3.3%, and of durable goods 3.2%, boosted by optical, film, photo and sound items. The sales of vehicles in general showed a decline of 9.6% in the month. The increasing trend of retail commerce had been shown by the indicators of São Paulo Trade Association (ACSP), regarding consultations of its Credit Protection Service (SPC) and the Usecheque with 3.5% and 3.2% variations respectively, compared to June, seasonally adjusted series. 
Besides the payment of the remaining balance of the FGTS and the increase in agricultural sector income, the recent expansion of commerce turnover could be associated to factors such as increasing promotions and special sales in the period. 
Another possible effect of the previously mentioned factors was the reduction of defaults to 7.2% in July from 8.3% in June, according to ACSP, mainly due to an increase of 23.4% of canceled registers (reinstatement). Also, in the financial market, the default data was favorable in July, when the percentage of returned checks due to insufficient funds showed a decline in relation to the total of cleared checks, reaching 4.7% as compared to 5% in June. 
The volume of credit supplied remained stable in July. In addition to tighter selectivity imposed by financial institutions, demand remains constrained due to the uncertain economic scenario, together with higher interest rates, which reflected on the movement of the futures market. 
The outstanding credit operations provided by the financial system registered an increase of 2.2% in the month, totaling R$359.5 billion, of which R$213.1 billion referred to operations contracted by freely established rates, representing an increase of 1.7%. This outcome was related, for the third successive month, to resources with external funding, which registered a monthly nominal growth of 5.3%, basically due to exchange rate variation of 20.5% in the period. 
Credit contracted by private individuals with freely allocated resources totaled R$75.9 billion, in July, showing a decline of 0.8%. The daily average of new credits declined 4.7%, influenced by the payment of debts and commitments with the use of the FGTS reimbursements and of tax returns from the Internal Revenue (IR). In the period, the reduction in demand for personal credit and for borrowings for acquisition of vehicles should be highlighted. 
The credit market had stagnated in part because of worsening of expectations in the last few months. The Index of Consumer Intentions (IIC) released by Fecomércio-SP, declined 5.5% in August, recording the second worst level of the year. Above all, the result was due to perceived deterioration of current economic environment, influenced mainly by the volatility in foreign exchange market. It should be noted that the August survey was carried out before the announcement of Brazil’s new agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). 
The National Confederation of Industries’, (CNI) and Getulio Vargas Foundation’s (FGV) business surveys also registered the deterioration of expectations. The Confidence Index of the Industry Entrepreneur (ICEI), composed by the results of the CNI Industrial Survey, declined to 48.5 points in July, from 58.9 points in April, showing the same level as July 2001, at the peak of uncertainty due to the energy crisis. But, the perceptions of entrepreneurs, like those of consumers, regarding future expectations are less pessimistic than in respect to the current economic conditions. Another point to be noted in relation to those surveys was the fact that the entrepreneurs were referring to the general economic situation, and not to their own companies, as the main factor responsible for the recent behavior of the expectations. 
In the last few months, the activity in industry clearly illustrated the deteriorating expectations. The industrial production that, in May, showed a 5.2% decline from the previous month, registered a variation of 0.8% in June, according to IBGE seasonally adjusted data. The results confirmed that the decline of production to a lower level was already becoming apparent in the previous month, reaching the same production level of July 2001, when the economy was facing the effects of the electricity rationing. It should be noted that the categories of durable consumer goods and capital goods were significantly affected in the 3rd bimester - May/June -, when the average levels of production were, respectively, 6.6% and 3.6% lower than the averages registered in the first four months of the year. 
In fact, the general investment indicators are showing deceleration, influenced especially by lack of dynamism in the civil construction industry. Imports of capital goods declined significantly in May and June, but partially due to the customs strike. The domestic production of machinery and equipment showed a decline of 1.1% in the semester, but the hike in non-serial machinery for industry, transport equipment, and agricultural machinery and its related equipment should be mentioned. Regarding financing through the Brazilian Development Bank (BNDES), the resources directed to the sectors of infrastructure and agriculture merit note. 
The loss of economic dynamism in the last few months reflected on the labor market. Although the average of open unemployment rate measured by IBGE had declined to 7.5% in June, from 7.7%, in May, the Economically Active Population (PEA) declined for the first time this year, indicating that the perception of those who were looking for job that opportunities had diminished. The decline in the unemployment rate was due to the decline of 0.2% in the number of employed workers and of 3% in the number of unemployed workers. It must be pointed out that the average rate of unemployment reached 7.3% in the first semester, with prominence to the increase of 22% in the number of people looking for jobs and of 2.4% in the level of employed workers, in relation to the same period in the previous year. In the area of formal employment, according to the Ministry of Labor and Employment, there was a growth of 3%, compared to the first semester of 2001. 
Regarding the external sector, the trade balance registered a surplus of US$1.2 billion in July, with US$6.2 billion of exports and US$5 billion of imports. Thus, the accumulated surplus in the year reached US$3.8 billion and the accumulated surplus of twelve months to July 2002, reached US$6.4 billion. The trade balance surplus of twelve-month to July 2002 was the best result for equivalent periods since 1995. 
In August, considering twelve business days, the trade balance accumulated a surplus of US$831 million, with daily average exports of US$256 million, against US$217 million average for the whole year. The daily average of imports in August, of US$187 million, is almost the same level as observed for the whole year average. The increase of exports of commodities and semi-manufactured goods in July should be noted, and, the fact that even after incorporating the rise in the prices of some products such as soy beans, crude oil, crude soy oil and cellulose, a significant increase of exported quantities of the main products of theses categories was maintained. 
In summary, the economic activity registered, by the end of the first semester and beginning of the second, a relatively low productivity plateau, due to the deterioration of expectations as a result of the unfavorable external environment and due to the increase of uncertainties related to the elections period. However, there are factors that contributed to suggest favorable prospects for the evolution of economic activity, such as the performance of retail trade – supported, amongst other factors, by the FGTS disbursements and by the agricultural income - and the improved, even if partial, expectation, as a result of the new IMF agreement. 
Despite the recent improvements, global financial markets remained volatile and averse to risk, reflecting uncertainty as a result of corporate results, due to accounting frauds and bankruptcies of large conglomerates, mainly in the United States. As a result, the financing conditions for emerging market countries have worsened, especially for Turkey and for those in Latin America. Expectations concerning a possible attack on Iraq have contributed to the uneasiness in the oil market, and prices returned to the level of US$30 per barrel. This scenario was aggravated by the further delay in the recovery of advanced countries, increasing protectionism and the decline in international trade. 
In the United States, macroeconomic indicators continued to show contradictory signals, predominating indication of deceleration in the pace of economic recovery. There were signs that the contagion of recent financial instability to the real economy was still underway. In its last meeting, the Federal Reserve kept the basic rate at 1.75% p.y., and the downward bias signals concern with the fragility of the economic recovery. The slower economic growth in the second quarter has contributed to keeping inflation under control. The business confidence indicators continued positive, although having presented a strong reversal in July. Consumer confidence indices also worsened in the last surveys, reflecting recent falls in the stock markets and higher unemployment rates. 
Pessimistic expectations regarding the performance of the Japanese economy have been gradually easing, as a result of the external trade performance. The Asian countries growth has stimulated Japanese exports, particularly of final goods. Despite the appreciation of the yen, reduction in imports has also contributed to the growth of the trade balance. Domestically, however, demand continued stagnant, since lower income constrains sustainable growth, and factory orders declined again in June, after showing expansion in the previous three months. Industrial production kept an upward trend in the 12-month accumulated figures, but at a declining rate. 
In the Euro Area, economic growth has shown itself to be weaker than projected. Domestic demand continued its slow recovery and industrial production remained stagnant. Despite the Euro appreciation, the trade balance accumulated over the 12 months up to May continued to expand, with higher imports and exports, especially sales to Great Britain and Asia. CPI annual variation reached 1.9% in July, slightly higher than in the previous month, but below the ceiling of 2% established by the European Central Bank. The main confidence indices point to declining expectations of both businesses and consumers. 
In Argentina, despite the slow pace of economic activity, some demand indicators, such as supermarket sales and shopping center sales, increased in the third quarter. Industrial production, in June, declined 1.4% compared to May and by 17.4% compared to June 2001. Figures for May indicated that 21.5% of the Economically Active Population was unemployed. The recession and the contraction of demand have been the cause of restrained prices, leading to declining inflation rates in the last three months. Administered prices were not revised since the floating of the peso at the beginning of the year. The trade balance registered a US$8.1 billion surplus in the first half of 2002, reflecting mainly the reduction of imports. 
The inflation rate measured by the main price indices accelerated in July, due to a mix of factors such as the concentration of readjustments in monitored prices in the period, the beginning of off-season period of agriculture and the effects of the recent exchange rate depreciation especially on wholesale prices.
The Consumer Price Index - Extended (IPCA) inflation was 1.19% in July, accumulating a 4.17% variation in the year and a 7.51% variation in 12 months. Similar to 2000 and 2001, July is likely to register the highest monthly variation in the year, mainly reflecting the readjustments in the public services tariffs. The monitored prices increased 2.52% and contributed individually with 0.78 of a percentage point to the general index variation. In addition to the readjustments in the fixed telephone tariffs approved on June 26, the IPCA reflected an average increase of 10.54% in electricity tariffs in São Paulo and Curitiba. Added to these factors, there were increases in the prices of oil-by products at the refineries (6.2% in bottled gas and 6.75% in gasoline), partially offset by the drop of 6.42% in the prices of hydrated alcohol. Furthermore, the effect of the rise in the minimum wage in April on the cost of housekeeper services is reflected in the IPCA mainly in July, for methodological reasons. 
The food prices showed the second highest increase in July, with a 1.05% rise (a 0.23 percentage point contribution), compared to a 0.08% rise in June. In addition to the continued recovery in agricultural prices since the end of harvest time, the recent exchange rate depreciation caused an increase in the prices of French rolls and soy oil, which were the items that most increased in the month. The IPCA was also under pressure of prices of clothing that have significantly impacted the index since April, accumulating a rise of 4.7% in the last four months. It should be registered that the monthly inflation would have reached a significantly lower level if there had been no increases in monitored prices. The free prices, though they have increased in relation to May and June, varied 0.59% in the period. 
In July, the General Price Index - Domestic Supply (IGP-DI) rose by 2.05%, reaching a 6.21% variation in the year and a 10.17% variation in the last 12 months. The Wholesale Price Index (IPA-DI) increased 2.82%, due to the 4.39% rise in the agricultural prices and 2.23% rise in the industrial prices, reflecting the beginning of the off-season period of agriculture and the evolution of the exchange rate. Amongst the industrial products, the evolution of the prices of refined soy oil, fertilizers and rice was notable. Amongst the agricultural prices, out soy, cattle, wheat, beans, eggs, fresh milk, cocoa, tobacco and corn should be highlighted. The Consumer Price Index (IPC-DI) rose by 1.03%, which was the highest monthly increase in the year. The IPC-DI was under pressure basically from the same factors mentioned for the IPCA. 
In August, the IPCA variation may retract, due to the declining contribution of the monitored prices, mainly because of less impact as a result of the readjustments in fixed telephone tariffs and fuel. Nevertheless, this group may still increase, due to the rises in water and sewage tariffs in São Paulo and in airline fares, in addition to the residual effects of the readjustments in electricity tariffs in July and the absorption of the increase of the minimum wage on the housekeepers’ wages. The food prices will continue to be pressured, due mainly to rises in the prices of items with relevant weight in the index, like milk and its by-products, beef and poultry, that have increased at wholesale level. The group of other items that make up the free prices may fall in relation to July, mainly influenced by the prices of clothing. These prices may reflect the typical sales season. 
One aspect to be noted in the trend of the IPCA until December is that the main impact of the monitored prices forecasted for the year – communications (telephones), electricity and urban transport - has already occurred. There remains to be implemented some readjustments in electricity tariffs in some capitals, but these readjustments would have a relatively small effect. Thus, considering no new increases in fuel prices in the coming months, the monthly variations, till the end of the year, would basically result from the evolution of the free prices. 
The perception of scarce foreign capital due to the reduction of the external credit lines and to the deterioration of the country’s risk have resulted in a steepening of the slope of the yield curve. The spread between the 1-year interest rate and the Over-Selic target reached 1.234 bps on July 29 from 878 bps on July 16. After the announcement of the agreement with the IMF, the slope reverted somewhat and, on August 20, the spread narrowed to 765 bps. 
Between July 17 and August 20 the BCB carried out two partial rollovers of the BCB’s Notes - E Series (NBCE), by offering exchange rate swaps with varied maturities. For the rollover of R$1,9 billion in NBCEs, due on July 25, the reference value of the swap contract reached R$1,1 billion. For the rollover of the R$7.6 billion NBCE maturing on August 15 the equivalent of R$4,7 billion exchange rate swaps were placed. The BCB also offered exchange rate swaps against the R$2,3 billion National Treasury Note – D Series (NTN-D), maturing on August 7, but these were not placed due to low demand. It should be pointed out that in this period only 50% of the exchange rate indexed debt was rolled over as a result of the weak demand for exchange rate hedging. 
The National Treasury carried out five National Treasury Bills (LTN) and National Treasury Financial Bills (LFT) auctions, limiting the total offer to 500 thousand securities for each one. In the first two, securities maturing in September were auctioned, and, in the others, the maturity was October 2002. The total financial volume was R$2.6 billion, of which R$2.1 billion were in LTN. 
In order to reduce financial market exposure to the LFT's price volatility, the BCB purchased bills maturing in 2003 on four occasions amounting to R$10.0 billion, and another R$3.0 billion, maturing in 2004. Those purchases were linked to the sale of securities with repurchase agreements in November and December 2004. Besides that, the BCB redeemed R$0.8 billion of LFT, due in 2002, and carried two exchange operations by placing LFT maturing in 2003 and repurchasing securities in the amount of R$2.46 billion maturing in 2004, R$2.28 billion maturing in 2005 and R$9.66 billion maturing in 2006. 
Throughout the 24 working day period between July 18 and August 20, BCB intervened in the open market by withdrawing and providing liquidity at one and three working day tenure and yields of 17.9% and 18.0% p.a., and average daily volumes of R$20.7 billion and R$3.3 billion, respectively. There were also selling operations of five long term securities with repurchase agreement, with a total financial value of R$13.3 billion and an average tenure of 78 working days — four of these operations (R$13.0 billion) were simultaneously placed with the purchase of LFT by the BCB, as mentioned above. 
As regards the financial settlements between July 18 and August 20, the monetary impact was expansionary by R$35.1 billion, resulting mainly from the R$13.0 billion redemptions of LTN and the R$17.0 billion net redemptions of exchange rate indexed securities and R$3.9 billion of LTN. 
In the process of reducing the volatility of investment funds composed by exchange rates indexed securities and DI x USD swaps, four exchange operations of NBCE and NTN-D by LFT and exchange rate swaps of equivalent tenure were carried out reaching R$19.2 billion. 
In July, the domestic federal securitized debt increased by R$20.7 billion (+3,2%). The exchange rate indexed securities grew by R$33.1 billion, due to the 20.5% appreciation of the USD in the period. 
The identified shocks and their impact were assessed according to newly available information. The scenario considered in the simulations covers the following hypotheses: 
1. For the year 2002, still as a result of the price drop in January and February, a reduction of 0.8% is forecast for the price of gasoline, albeit at a higher value than the previous one forecast in the last Copom meeting (-2,0%). For bottled gas, an increase of 25% is projected for 2002, a significantly lower increase than the 42% projected in the last meeting. This change is due in part to the 12% decline in the bottled gas price at refineries in August. 
2. For the electricity tariffs, an increase of 20.1% for 2002 is projected, in comparison to the 19.2% projected in July. The forecast for the readjustment of electricity tariffs for 2003 increased substantially, to 20.7% in August from 14.4% in July, mainly due to the exchange rate depreciation. 
3. Regarding the set of prices administered by contracts and monitored, with a weighting of 31.05% in the IPCA, the inflation forecast for 2002 fell 0.1 p.p. in relation to the previous Copom meeting. For 2002 as a whole, a readjustment of 8.8% is projected for the prices administered by contracts and monitored. The reduction in the projection is due to the expected decline of the consumer price of bottled gas in August and September. The fall in the total of the prices administered by contracts and monitored is not larger due to the effects of exchange rate depreciation. For 2003, the inflation forecast for the prices administered by contracts and monitored is 7.6%. In July, the same forecast was 6.6%. The increase in the projection for 2003 is mainly due to the revision of the readjustments projected for electricity. 
4. The projection of the 6-months spread over the Selic rate, applying a model specification based on an error correction forecasting method and maintaining constant the Selic rate at 18.0% p.a., starts from approximately 600 b.p. in the third quarter of 2002 and declines to -70 b.p. in the last quarter of 2003. 
The monthly inflation rate, measured by IPCA, reached 1.19% in July, in comparison to 0.42% registered in June. The core inflation of the IPCA, calculated by the symmetric trimmed-mean method, increased to 0.51% in July from 0.40% in June. In the last twelve months, this core varied 7.08%. In turn, the core inflation of the Consumer Price Index- Brazil (IPC-BR), calculated by the symmetric trimmed-mean method, fell to 0.40% in July from 0.41% in June. In the last twelve months, this core registered a 6.62% variation. The core inflation calculated by excluding the prices administered by contracts and monitored and household food prices registered a variation of 0.39% in July, accumulating a variation of 6.12% in twelve months. 
The variation accumulated by the IPCA in twelve months registered 7.51% in July, below the observed in June (7.66%) and in May (7.77%). Free market prices contributed to inflation with 4.11 p.p. and the prices administered by contracts and monitored with 3.40 p.p. 
The inflation expectations surveyed by BCB's Investor Relations Group (Gerin) for 2002 increased to 6.4% in August from 5.8% in July. For 2003, the expectations increased to 4.6% in August from 4.2% in July. 
Regarding the fiscal policy, the hypothesis considered is to achieve the primary surplus of 3.75% for the consolidated public sector. The other assumptions considered in the previous meeting were maintained. 
From the simulation exercises with several specifications of the structural model, it has been concluded that the maintenance of the interest rate at 18.0% p.a. and the exchange rate at the level observed on the eve of the Copom meeting indicates an inflation rate over 6.0% in 2002 and below the target of 4.0% in 2003. 
The economic activity continues to show loss of dynamism, already identified in the last few months, due to the recent volatility of the financial markets and to its impact on aggregate demand. In fact, comparing the seasonally adjusted data of June to those of May, one perceives that industry does not show signs of recovery. According to the CNI, there was a decline in employment (0.07%), in the real payroll (0.25%) and in the utilization of installed capacity (0.36%). 
There are factors that have softened the pace of deceleration of the level of activity. Firstly, agricultural production in 2002 should exceed 2001. Secondly, one may perceive an improvement in the commercial sector: the real turnover of the retail commerce in São Paulo rose approximately 3.5% in July, mainly in non-durable consumption goods. In this segment, demand has been sustained by the increase of agricultural income, the liberation of balances of the Time in Service Guarantee Fund (FGTS) and the social programs expenditures, in spite of the 5.49% decline of the Consumer Intentions Index between July and August. 
The improvement in commerce may not influence industry due to increase in inventories of finished products in the last months. According to data released by the CNI, the indicator of finished products inventory rose to 53.1 in August from 50.4 in July, compared to the desirable value of 50 for the inventories level. 
The current account of the balance of payments had registered substantial improvement in the last twelve months. The trade balance showed a US$ 1.2 billion surplus in July. Its surplus totaled US$ 6.4 billion in the twelve months to July, which represented an increase of approximately US$ 1.1 billion in relation to the value registered in June. The current account deficit has continuously declined since August 2001 and reached US$ 16.7 billion in the twelve months to July. This deficit was more than entirely financed by the net inflows of foreign direct investment, which totaled approximately US$ 20.6 billion in the twelve months to July. However, the ongoing adjustment in the current account was not sufficient to neutralize the international liquidity shortage that had recently occurred, affecting even the funding of foreign trade. The contraction of external financing was reflected in the pressures on the exchange rate, which had intensified in July. 
The inflation expectations surveyed by the Investor Relations Group (Gerin) of the BCB rose since the Copom’s meeting of July. For 2002, the expectations increased by 0.6 p.p., reaching 6.4% from 5.8%, probably due to the exchange rate depreciation observed in the period. For 2003, the inflation expectations were revised by 0.4% p.p., rising to 4.6% from 4.2%. 
The inflation measured by the IPCA was 1.19% in July, above the 0.42% registered in June, due to the behavior of administered by contracts or monitored prices, which increased by 2.52%, and to the behavior of free market prices, whose inflation was 0.47 p.p. higher than in the previous month. The inflation of administered or monitored prices was mainly influenced by the readjustments of bottled gas (4.42% in July and 38.3% year-to-date), of gasoline (2.87% in July and -0.2% year-to-date) and of fixed-line telephone tariffs (10.54%) and electricity (4.26%). The administered or monitored prices would lead to weaker inflationary pressures in August and September, mainly because of the 9.9% price reduction expected for bottled gas. 
The inflation of the free market prices in July was mainly due to the pass-through of the exchange rate depreciation. After showing a 0.64% variation in February and decreasing significantly in the following months, the free prices inflation reached 0.59% in July. When household food items of the free market prices were excluded, which corresponds to the core inflation measured with the exclusion of the administered prices and of household food items, the inflation increases to 0.39% in July, from 0.13% in June. The variation of the core inflation measured by the symmetric trimmed-mean method also increased, reaching 0.51% in July, from 0.40% in June. 
The higher variations of the free market and administered prices in July were already expected, thus they did not cause upward revisions in the inflation projection for 2002. However, there was an increase in the inflation projection for 2002 and 2003 due to the exchange rate depreciation that has occurred since the Copom’s July meeting. For 2002, an inflation above 6.0% is expected and, for 2003, the projected inflation is still below the 4.0% target. 
The lower inflation in 2003, in comparison to 2002, may be explained by a set of factors. Firstly, the existing idle capacity in the economy tends to reduce the inflation of non-tradable goods prices. Secondly, administered and monitored prices are forecasted to increase by 7.6% in the coming year that is equivalent to a 1.2% decline in relation to the increase of 2002. Finally, in the basic scenario one assumes the maintenance of the exchange rate in 2003 at the level observed on the eve of the Copom’s meeting, and so, the absence of additional depreciation. Furthermore, it is predicted that the larger part of the impact of the recent exchange rate depreciation should still occur in 2002. Due to the magnitude of the depreciation and of the current exchange rate level, the existence of idle capacity in the economy may be insufficient to soften the exchange rate pass-through to prices in the course of this year. Based on the analysis of the behavior of the free prices inflation in the first seven months of the year, one may conclude that up to this moment, there are no signs of a significant accumulation of exchange rate pass-through to prices that would be carried over to 2003. 
Despite the projected inflation for 2003 being below the target, the Copom recognizes that there was an increase of uncertainties in relation to the realization of the basic scenario hypotheses until the end of next year. The increase in the risk perception, both in relation to Brazil and to the industrialized countries, has caused higher volatility in the financial markets and foreign capital inflows. In this context, the interventions in the foreign exchange market have been necessary to manage the excessive volatility of the exchange rate in a liquidity short environment, and to avoid perverse dynamics in the foreign exchange market. 
The increase of uncertainty in relation to the country’s future, aggravated by deterioration in the risk perception regarding the world economy since the Copom’s meeting of July, has negatively influenced the asset prices in foreign and local currencies. The risk measured by the Embi+ reached more than 2000 b.p. and the thirty-day volatility of the exchange rate increased to 49.0% from 20.3% between the Copom’s meetings of July and August. The exchange rate depreciated 9.4% in the same period. 
However, the agreement with the IMF and with its general principles being supported by the main presidential candidates, the reduction of discounts of public securities and the recent evolution of the mutual funds sector, and an improvement in the liquidity conditions of international credit lines for Brazil, provide an adequate environment to revert expectations in the financial market.
"
27/09/2002;75;Arminio Fraga;"The recently released economic indicators related to retail activity and external trade, show favorable signs. Domestically, the results are a consequence of the measures implemented with the objective of normalizing the foreign exchange market (IMF agreement among others), and a reflex of the effects of the Time in Service Guarantee Fund (FGTS) extraordinary disbursements initiated in June. The positive performance of international sales is closely related to the exchange rate stimulus. 
Preliminary data from São Paulo State's Federation of Commerce (Fecomércio-SP) indicate an expansion of 4.1% in real turnover of retail commerce in the metropolitan region of São Paulo in August, not considering the seasonal factors. The higher increases were observed in sales of non-durable consumer goods and construction materials. The monthly growth of 1.7% of Usecheque consultations, released by São Paulo Trade Association (ACSP), pointed in the same direction. 
Vehicle sales also reacted in August, stimulated in part by the sales promotions, taking advantage of the reduction of the Industrialized Products Tax (IPI), which momentarily altered the sales mix in favor of more expensive vehicles. This movement, however, should not be considered a trend as yet, since the vehicle concessionaires registered, in August, an expansion in cash sales. Credit sales, which normally are more significant in relation to more expensive durable consumer goods, are not progressing due to the unfavorable credit conditions and consumer caution (as registered by the credit sales consultations to the Service Protection Service - SPC - from the ACSP, which declined 3.5% in August) and the retraction in the volume of new concessions to private individuals by the financial system. 
Another positive piece of information from commerce refers to the consumers confidence level recuperation as related to the economic conditions. Consumers Intentions Index (IIC) grew 9.6% in September, reaching 100.4 in a scale from 0 to 200, the best result since May 2001. The result was due to the perception of improvement of current and future conditions. 
Defaults have declined significantly in August, possibly due to the continuity of the use of part of the values released from FGTS resources to pay off debts. According to ACSP, the maintenance of the reinstatement registers at much higher levels than the previous average permitted the decline of the default rate to 4.7% in August from 7.2% in July and in the year. In the financial market, the default decline could be verified by the reduction of returned checks to 4.3% in August from 4.7% in July due to insufficient funds in relation to the total of cleared checks. 
As regards the credit market, the default of the credit portfolio with freely allocated resources fell 0.2 p.p. in August, reaching 7.8% of the portfolio, the lowest value since last November. The implementation of more conservative credit policies by the financial institutions, such as the reduction of individual limits, credit line cutoffs for certain clients and additional guarantee requests, also contributed to the default decline. 
This higher selectivity in the credit offer has diminished the volume of new concessions, making the balance of these operations decline. Credit operations inventory with legal entities contracted by free established rates fell 3.8% in the month, reaching R$132.0 billion. The volume of resources with internal funding declined 1.9% and those with external funding declined 7.2%, reflecting the exchange rate appreciation of 11.85% in the month. 
The volume of credit to private individuals totaled R$76.2 billion, rising 0.4% in August. The daily average concessions grew 0.5%, while the new concessions flow declined 3.9% in the month, due to the lower number of business days in August in comparison to July. The relative stability of the balance of this segment continued to be influenced by debt liquidations from Income Tax (IR) returns and FGTS reimbursements, besides the deteriorating credit conditions in the last months. 
Industrial activity maintained in July the same production level observed in the previous month, according to the seasonally adjusted indexes from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). The result confirmed the lower production level in comparison to the first months of the year, but is still considered favorable, since the increase of industrial stocks and the lowering of entrepreneur expectancy levels, registered in the same period, which could mean a decline of the industrial activity in the month. 
This leveling off of industrial production in the last months interrupted the stronger recovery trend that had been occurring since the beginning of the year. However, taking into account the turbulences that negatively affected the entrepreneurs and consumers confidence in June and July, the recent results are favorable, since they have exceeded the expectations outlined by some previous variables that had indicated a fall in production. 
In July, the National Confederation of Industries (CNI) statistics confirmed the idea that the activity level in the industrial sector is showing a tendency to be self- sustaining. For the second consecutive month industrial sales grew, 0.9% in comparison to June, and the installed capacity utilization level was 0.85% above that registered in the previous month, both in seasonally adjusted series. 
In the labor market, the average rate of open unemployment, measured by IBGE, remained stable at 7.5% in July. This result was due to equivalent percentage growth rates in the number of employed workers and in the Economically Active Population (PEA). Regarding the formal work environment, according to the Ministry of Labor and Employment, there was a 0.2% growth in July and a 3.2% growth accumulated over twelve months. 
In relation to the external sector, the commercial surplus of US$1.6 billion registered in August was the highest since May 1990, and has accumulated US$7.4 billion in twelve months. The current account deficit in twelve months, reached US$16.7 billion, up to July. This was the lowest result for this kind of comparison since July 1996. 
The trade balance totaled a surplus of US$931.0 million up to the 15th day of September, as exports registered another increase in the daily average, reaching US$284.0 million, in comparison to US$224.0 million in the year. The US$190.0 million daily imports average in September is almost at the same level observed in the January to August period. Thus, the surplus for the year reached US$6.3 billion, in comparison to US$0.8 billion occurred in the same period in 2001. Exports reached US$39.9 billion while the imports totaled US$33.6 billion, falling 4.4% and 18.0%, respectively, in comparison with the values registered in the same period in 2001. 
This trade balance result reversion reveals the importance of deeper modifications in the economic structure, such as imports substitution and higher exports profitability, which is enabling the diversification of the trade products and the entry into new markets. Some current factors, such as the depreciation of the Real and the level of deceleration of the economic activity, have also contributed to this scenario. 
In summary, the activity level indicators show signs of retail commerce recuperation, which have shown sales growth, reduction in default levels and consumers confidence recuperation. The industrial activity, however, remains stable and reflects the stocks’ adjustment process. 
The international scenario continues very unstable, with a corresponding reflection in the various segments of the international financial market by increased volatility. The accumulated losses in the stock exchanges in the last two years and the impact provoked by the accounting scandals of big U.S. corporations increased the fragility of the global economy. More recently, the expectations concerning a possible attack on Iraq have contributed to the uneasiness in the oil market, and prices returned to the level of US$30 per barrel. In this framework of instability and risk aversion, financing conditions have worsened for emerging economies, also affected by the decline in international trade. 
In the United States, macroeconomic indicators continue to show contradictory signs, reinforcing the uncertainties about the sustainability of the economic recovery. The business confidence indicators remain positive, although having presented a new decline in August. Consumers confidence indices also worsened in the last surveys, reflecting the recent falls in the stock market and the unemployment rates, which remain high, in spite of the fall to 5.7% in August, compared to 5.9% in July. Retail sales increased by 0.8% in August, stimulated by the favorable vehicle purchase financing conditions. Factory orders increased by 4.7% in July, the largest expansion since October 2001, led by durable goods orders, particularly transport equipment and industrial machinery. Inflationary pressures remain weak but budget deficit increase, that may reach 1.5% of GDP in the fiscal year ending in September, is a cause for concern. 
In Japan, the good performance of the external trade has contributed to reduce pessimistic expectations. The growth of Asian countries has boosted Japanese exports, especially of finished goods, in spite of the yen appreciation. Factory orders declined by 8.5% compared to those of July 2001 and the beginning of new constructions declined by 6.7%, also compared annually. The accumulated variation over 12 months of industrial production reached 3.3%, maintaining an upward trend, but at a declining rate. 
Economic growth is slower in the Euro area, in line with the expected fragility of global recovery. Domestic demand remains retracted, as shown by retail sales, which declined by 0.9% in the 12-month accumulated figure up to June. Industrial production does not show any reaction, with negative annual variations since September 2001. 
Unemployment rate remained stable at 8.3% in July. In spite of the euro appreciation, the trade balance accumulated in the 12 months up to June continued to grow, with higher exports and imports. The main confidence indicators registered a decline in the expectations of both consumers and businesses. The estimates for the growth/variation of prices in August indicate an annual rate of 2.1%, above the ceiling of the European Central Bank (ECB). 
Regarding Argentina, recession and demand contraction have been responsible for restraining price increases, leading the inflation rates to decline in the past three months, but administered prices have not yet been readjusted since the floating of the peso, at the beginning of the year. The trade balance registered a US$2.2 billion surplus in July, still reflecting on the whole the contraction of imports. 
Regarding the Mexican economy, the Economic Activity Global Indicator has been showing a downward trend, in spite of the positive variations in the second quarter of 2002, reflecting the increase of the link with the U.S. economic performance in the past years. About 90% of the exports go to the U.S., coming from the “maquiladoras”. The Mexican GDP grew by 2.1% in the second quarter, led by the growths of 2.5% in the industrial sector and of 2.2% in services.  
Inflation remained high in August, mainly reflecting the effects of the between harvest period in agriculture and the impacts of the recent exchange rate depreciation. Nevertheless, the consumer price indices showed smaller variation in comparison to the previous month, mainly due to the end of the impacts of the recent readjustments in monitored prices. 
The Consumer Price Index - Extended (IPCA) increased by 0.65% in August, accumulating variations of 4.85% year-to-date and 7.46% over 12 months. The monthly result was influenced by a 1.94% rise in food and beverage prices, due to the exchange rate depreciation and the between harvest period. The French roll was the product with the highest individual contribution to the result of the month, corresponding to 0,14 p.p. in the IPCA rate. Still in the food and beverage group, the increases in prices of cattle and chicken meat, soy oil and milk, should be highlighted. The decline in the monthly variation in comparison to July (1.19%) was due to the smaller variation of monitored prices (0.22% as against 2.52% in the previous month). In August, despite the rises in airline fares and in water and sewage tariffs, smaller increases in the tariffs of telephone and electricity and in housekeepers' wages were registered, whilst the prices of gasoline, alcohol and bottled gas have declined. 
The effects of the exchange rate depreciation and between harvest period were stronger in the General Price Index – Domestic Supply, due to their impact on wholesale prices of agricultural and industrial goods. The monthly variation increased to 2.36% in August from 2.05% in July, accumulating 8.75% in the year and 11.76% in 12 months. The Wholesale Price Index - Domestic Supply (IPA-DI) rose by 3.32% in the month, reflecting the increases of 5.48% in agricultural prices and of 2.5% in industrial prices. The Consumer Price Index (IPC) followed the IPCA deceleration, due to the smaller pressure of monitored prices. The IPC rose by 0.76% and the IPC-core increased 0.65%. 
The maintenance of the pressures derived from the recent exchange rate depreciation and from the continuity of the increase of food prices should be the main factors to influence the indices in September. Nevertheless, the rates of the main price indices should continue decelerating, if the effect of the reduction of the bottled gas price in September and the prospect of smaller increases in food prices, in the next few months, are considered. 
During the week after Copom's August meeting, the interest rate curve steepened significantly. Subsequently, this curve fluctuated as a result of the internal and external environment. On September 17, the spread between the 1-year interest rate and the Over-Selic target reached 710 bps from 765 bps in August 20. 
Between August 21 and September 17 the foreign exchange instruments rollover reached 90%. For the rollover of US$0.3 billion in National Treasury Notes – D Series (NTN-D) and US$1.3 billion exchange rate swaps maturing on September 1 and 2 respectively, the equivalent of US$1.5 billion exchange rate swaps was placed, of which 72% due on 2002 and 28% on 2003. For the rollover of US$0.5 billion in National Treasury Notes – D Series (NTN-D) and US$1.5 billion exchange rate swaps maturing on September 11, the reference value of the swap contract reached US$1.8 billion, of which 80% due on 2003 and 20% on 2002. 
The National Treasury carried out four National Treasury Bills (LTN) and National Treasury Financial Bills (LFT) auctions. Securities maturing in 2002 were auctioned in the first two, with a 500 thousand securities total offer limit for each one. In the other two auctions the National Treasury altered its strategy, by offering just LTN maturing in November 2002 and January 2003 and by raising the limit to a million securities. The total operation amounted to R$2.9 billion, of which R$2.0 billion were in LTN redeeming in 2002 and another RS$0.9 billion in LTN redeeming in 2003. 
In the same period, aiming to reduce LFT price volatility, Banco Central carried out ten selling auctions of LFT due on August 2003, which could be settled by delivering LFT maturing in 2004 and 2006. Furthermore, the purchaser had the choice of contracting forward operations maturing in December 2002, up to the limit of 20% of the purchased LFT. Those operations totaled R$3.9 billion. With the same objective, Banco Central carried out ten redeeming auctions of LFT with several maturities between 2002 and 2003. In these operations the equivalent of R$5.6 billion of LFT were taken from the market, of which R$5.2 billion were due on 2003. 
Throughout the 19 working day period between August 22 and September 17, BCB intervened in the open market by withdrawing and providing liquidity at yields of 17.9% and 18.0% p.a., and average daily volumes of R$32.4 billion and R$4.5 billion, respectively. The tenures oscillated from one to two working days. There were also three selling operations of long-term securities with repurchase agreement, with a total financial value of R$8.3 billion and an average tenure of 21 working days. 
Regarding the financial settlements between August 22 and September 17, the monetary impact was expansionary by R$16.7 billion, mainly as a result of the net redemptions of R$6.7 billion of LTN, R$6.0 billion of LFT and R$3.8 of exchange rate indexed securities. 
In August, the domestic federal securitized debt declined by R$51.6 billion (7.7%). The exchange rate indexed securities stock declined by R$31.9 billion, basically due to the 11.85% appreciation of the Real in the period. 
The identified shocks and theirs impacts were assessed according to newly available information. The scenario considered in the simulations encompasses the following assumptions: 
1. For the year 2002, an increase of 3.3% in the price of gasoline is expected, representing a higher value than the one forecasted in the last Copom meeting (-0.8%). This revision is a consequence of the pass-through of the international petroleum price increase and the new exchange rate level to the gasoline consumer price. For bottled gas, a growth of approximately 25% in 2002 is maintained, as forecasted at the last Copom meeting, since the 12% reduction of the bottled gas price at the refineries in August had already been considered in the forecasts. 
2. For the readjustment of the residential electricity tariffs, an increase of 20.6% in 2002 is projected, of which 16.2% has already occurred between January and August. The value projected in September is slightly higher than the one projected in August. For the next few months, a readjustment of 3.8% is forecasted. The electricity readjustment forecast for 2003 remained at 20.7%. 
3. Regarding the set of prices administered by contracts and monitored, with a 31.5% weight in the IPCA in August, the inflation forecast in 2002 grew by 0.5 p.p. in relation to the last Copom meeting. For the year 2002 as a whole, an increase of 9.3% in the prices administered by contracts and monitored is projected, in comparison to 8.8% in August and 8.9% in July. The increase of the projection is due to the exchange rate pass-through and the revision of the gasoline forecast. For 2003, the inflation forecast for the prices administered by contracts and monitored is 7.9%, while in August this forecast was 7.6%. The increase in the projection for 2003 is a consequence of the exchange rate depreciation and the revision of the expectations regarding the IGP-M, which influence the forecasts of some prices administered by contracts and monitored, especially those linked to transport. 
4. The forecast of the 6-month spread over the Selic rate, based on an error correction model specification. Maintaining constant the Selic rate in 18.0% p.a., the 6-month spread projection starts at 510 bp. in the third quarter of 2002, and, afterwards, declines up to the end of 2003. 
The monthly inflation rate measured by the IPCA reached 0.65% in August, in comparison to 1.19% in July. The core inflation of the IPCA, calculated under the symmetric trimmed-mean method, grew to 0.65% in August from 0.51% in July. In the last twelve months, this core registered a variation of 7.17%. In turn, the core inflation of the Consumer Price Index - Brazil (IPC-BR), calculated under the symmetric trimmed-mean method, increased to 0.65% in August from 0.40% in July. In twelve months, this core registered a variation of 6.69%. The core inflation calculated by excluding prices administered by contracts and household food registered a variation of 0.38% in August and 6.10% in twelve months. 
The IPCA variation in twelve months has been showing a declining trend since May and registered 7.46% in August, a value below the ones observed in July (7.51%) and June (7.66%). In these twelve months, the free market prices contributed to inflation with 4.35 p.p., while the prices administered by contracts and monitored contributed with 3.11 p.p. 
Regarding fiscal policy, the hypothesis assumed is to achieve a 3.88% primary surplus for the consolidated public sector this year. For the following years the target is 3.75%. The remaining assumptions established in the previous meeting were maintained. 
From the simulation exercises with several specifications of the structural model, it has been concluded that the maintenance of the interest rate at 18.0% p.a. and the exchange rate at the same level as on the eve of the Copom meeting (R$3.20) lead to an inflation rate considerably above the upper limit of the tolerance interval in 2002 and above the target center in 2003.
Indicators of production continue to show the loss of dynamism of the economic activity. According to the IBGE, the seasonally adjusted series of the industrial production remained almost stable in July, compared to June. A 0.4% increase was registered in the year, up to July. Seasonally adjusted data from CNI corroborate these results, showing relative stability in employment (0.01% decline), in the hours worked in production (0.19% fall) and in the payroll (0.12% increase), between June and July. 
Contrasting with the indicators of production, those related to sales have registered positive results. The monthly variation of the industrial sales was 0.9% in July, according to the CNI, and the real turnover of the retail commerce in the city of São Paulo increased by 4.12% in August, according to preliminary data of the Fecomércio (seasonally adjusted series). At the end of the second quarter, also according to the CNI, there were excessive inventories of finished goods in the manufacturing industry, with the corresponding indicator leveling close to 53, above the reference-value of 50, which represents the adequate level for those inventories. Considering the sales and production results of July, inventories of finished goods are tending to the levels considered adequate by businessmen, favoring the recovery of industrial activity in the medium-term. Other factors that tend to favor industry in the medium-term are the liberation of balances of the Time in Service Guarantee Fund (FGTS) and the 9.6% increase of the Consumer Intentions Index in September. One highlights that the sub-item “future intentions index” reached 108.6 in that month, whilst the reference-value of 100 indicates stability. However, the slow growth of credit, the high interest rates and the instability of the financial market tend to inhibit the recovery of economic growth. 
The more recent data about the performance of the foreign sector accounts show that the Balance of Payments has fast adjusted to the adverse conditions of the international market, characterized by the reduction of world economic growth, and by the reduction of foreign financing. However, the magnitude of the Balance of Payments adjustment has not been sufficient to avoid the pressure on the exchange rate caused by the reduction of international financing and by the uncertainties still present in the market, related to the future management of the macroeconomic policy in the country. 
The inflation expectations surveyed by the Investor Relations Group (Gerin) of the Banco Central do Brasil increased since the Copom’s meeting of August, noticeably for 2003. For 2002, the expectations reached 6.6%, from 6.4%. As for 2003, the inflation expectations were revised by 0.6 p.p., reaching 5.2% from 4.6%. The most important factors to explain such revisions are the accentuated exchange rate depreciation and the recent price increases of oil by-products in the international markets. 
Copom also increased the projections of inflation for 2002 and 2003, partly due to the revision of the readjustments of administered prices, to 9.3% from 8.8% this year, and to 7.9% from 7.6% in the coming year. According to the models used by the Banco Central, the behavior of the free prices inflation up to August is compatible with the exchange rate depreciation observed in the period. However, taking into account the size of the exchange rate depreciation registered during the year, its pass-through coefficient to prices may increase. Especially in the case of growth recovery, the possibility of a higher pass-through increases. However, in such a context of recovery of the activity level and of better expectations it would be reasonable to expect an exchange rate appreciation. Notwithstanding, Copom considered adequate to add an exchange rate pass-through not yet accounted for in the projection of inflation for the next year. 
There was a reduction of the discounts of federal securities, and a positive evolution of the financial funds industry, in the financial market. However, the uncertainties persisted. The real depreciated by 2.3% since the Copom’s meeting of August and the country risk measured by the Embi+ continued at high levels. This scenario of uncertainties reflects not only an adverse international environment, but also remaining doubts of some economic agents about the coherence of the macroeconomic policy in the coming years. Thus, in spite of the projected inflation for 2003 being below the target (adjusted for the shocks of the administered and monitored prices and for part of the inertia), the Copom understands that the maintenance of the volatility in the financial markets increases the risk related to the confirmation of this projection.
"
18/10/2002;76;Arminio Fraga;"Several price indices released recently have shown a rise in inflation caused mainly by exchange rate depreciation. The IPCA recorded 0.72% in September, higher than the value expected by the Copom and the 0.65% variation observed in August. This increase was a consequence of the inflation of free prices, with an increase of 1.05%. In contrast, there was deflation of the administered and monitored prices (0.01%), due to the reduction of 7.6% of the consumer price of bottled gas. 
The indicators of core-inflation have reflected this rise in the IPCA. Measured under the trimmed-mean method, the core increased to 0.78% in September from 0.65% in August, while the core calculated excluding administered and monitored prices and food items increased to 0.61% from 0.38%, in the same period. 
Preliminary data related to other price indices have also indicated a rise in inflation in October. According to IPC-Fipe, the inflation increased to 0.81% in the four-week period ended in the first week of October, from 0.73% in the four-week period ended in the third week of September and, regarding the IPC-M, the inflation registered in the first ten days of October increased to 0.49% from 0.42%. 
Since the Copom meeting in September, the trend of several economic indicators has changed inflation expectations for 2002 and 2003. According to the Investor Relation Group (Gerin), the median of the market expectations for the IPCA in 2003 rose to 5.9% from 5.2% since the September 16. 
The inflation forecast of the Copom for 2003 was also increased. The Copom had been basing its projections on a basic scenario in which the transition to the future government would occur without exaggerated or prolonged turbulences. The higher degree of uncertainty observed in the last months has lowered the probability of the materialization of this basic scenario. In fact, at the Copom meeting in September, the inflation forecasts were made based on an exchange rate of R$3.20/US$ and an inflation expectation (collected by Gerin) of 5.2% for 2003. Neither assumptions have been occurring. 
Between the last two Copom meetings, an additional depreciation of the Real, with the dollar reaching figures around R$3.90, and a rise in inflation expectations to 5.9% (surveyed by Gerin) for 2003 were observed. The IPCA projection was increased considerably, as a consequence. Despite the increase in the estimated primary shocks of administered and monitored prices, and the impact of inflation inertia of 2002 on the 2003 inflation, the projected inflation for 2003 is above the target adjusted to these factors. 
The increase in inflation - actual and forecasted - in the last months implies that, if the target for Selic-rate were maintained at 18% p.a., the real interest rate - ex-ante and ex-post - would be reduced significantly, which could stimulate the pass-through of exchange rate depreciation and the propagation of price adjustments. 
The rise of inflation projection over the adjusted target rate for 2003 recommends a tighter monetary policy, even if the primary cause of inflation were not related to an increase in demand, but rather to the effects of a significant exchange rate depreciation on domestic prices. A tighter monetary policy reduces the exchange rate pass-through to prices and improves inflation expectations. In this way, the conditions to restore sustainable growth – i.e., non-inflationary – would be in place as early as next year. 
The calling of a Copom extraordinary meeting had the objective of not postponing decisions that seem to be natural for the BCB committed to inflation targeting in a more adverse scenario. 
The members of Copom emphasized that, in spite of the relevance of recent exchange rate depreciation to the rise in inflation expectations, the monetary policy continues to be calibrated exclusively to maintain inflation in a trajectory within the targeted range; therefore, the monetary policy does not aim at targeting the exchange rate level. This does not mean that a reversion of the depreciation of the exchange rate in excess would not have meaningful consequences to the inflation trend and, consequently, to the monetary policy management. Obviously, an exchange rate appreciation, resulting from the restoration of confidence in future economic policy management, would reduce pressures over prices and improve the inflation expectations.
"
31/10/2002;77;Arminio Fraga;"Economic indicators continue to show stability in the level of activity, maintaining the trend outlined since May. This behavior is related to the presence of factors which have opposing effects on the economy in the last months. On the one hand, the increase of uncertainty, derived from the electoral process, and the consequent turbulence in the financial market have affected the performance of the sales of goods with higher value added and, most of all, investment outlays. On the other hand, the positive results of retail commerce – mainly associated to the nonscheduled disbursements of the Time in Service Guarantee Fund (FGTS), to the increase of employment level, and to the earnings from agriculture this year – and the favorable performance of the trade balance have contributed to sustain the activity level. 
According to the São Paulo State’s Federation of Commerce (Fecomércio), preliminary seasonally adjusted data point to a 2.4% increase of the real turnover in the São Paulo’s Metropolitan Region in September. The highest increases were observed in the sales of semi and non-durable consumption goods, and of construction materials. A countrywide survey carried out by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) also shows a trend of recovery of the retail sector in the last months. It should be noted that, according to Fecomércio data, even automobile sales, whose performance has been negative during the year, increased for the second consecutive month in September, still benefiting from sales promotions and from the reduction of Industrialized Products Tax (IPI). Furthermore, it should observed that the higher level of sales occurred mainly due to the increase of cash payments, in a similar way to August. 
The number of enquiries to the Credit Protection Service (SPC) and to the Usecheque of the São Paulo Trade Association (ACSP) in the first fortnight of October, in comparison to the same period of 2001, increased by 7.7% and 1.9%, respectively, indicating the continuity of the expansionist movement of sales in the retail commerce. 
In spite of the positive results of commerce, the scenario of uncertainties and the exchange rate volatility persist as determinants of the current economic scenario, according to the consumer expectations. As a consequence, the Consumers Intentions Index (ICC), released by the Fecomércio, declined 4.6%, mainly due to a decline of 8.4% in the indicator related to the current conditions of the economy. The future intentions indicator retracted by a smaller proportion, 2.2%. 
Still regarding the determinants of the retail commerce, the nonperforming loans increased by 6.7% in September, in comparison to 4.7% in the previous month, according to the ACSP survey. It should be noted that this result was more a consequence of the decline in the number of enquiries in June, the month used as reference to calculate the indicator, rather than from the rise of new net registrations. On the contrary, the cancelled registrations, thanks to the normalization of the debtors' situation, remained well above the year’s average, still reflecting the stimulus of debt redemptions, due to the payments of the FGTS. The proportion of returned checks due to insufficient funds in relation to the cleared ones continued to decline in September, reaching 4.3%, in comparison to the 5.5% peak-value of this series, registered in March 2002. 
The default of the credit portfolio with freely allocated resources of the financial institutions declined by 0.3 p.p. in September, reaching 7.9% of the (total) portfolio, the lowest value since November past year, also reflecting the more selective decisions of the banks in their credit operations in the last months. 
The outstanding credit operations contracted by corporations with freely established rates increased by 7.1% in the month, reaching R$ 141 billion. The volume of resources with domestic funding increased by 5.5% and those with external resources increased by 10.1%, reflecting the 21% exchange rate depreciation in the month. The volume of credit to private individuals totaled R$77.3 billion, rising by 1.5% in September. 
Industrial activity increased by 0.3% in August, according to the seasonally adjusted data of the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). This result was mainly due to the 2.1% expansion of the mineral extractive production, since the manufacturing industry registered an expansion of 0.1%. In the last three months production levels stayed practically static, reflecting, in general terms, the increase in the production of intermediate goods, particularly petroleum and gas, and the favorable performance of export segments that have offset the contraction of production of capital and consumer durable goods. 
In August, data from the National Confederation of Industries (CNI) showed an expansion of the industrial sales for the third consecutive month. Nevertheless, the stability of the utilization level of installed capacity in the last four months denotes that this sales growth was mainly due to the reduction of industry inventories. 
In the labor market, the average rate of open unemployment, measured by the IBGE, increased to 7.5%, in September, from 7.3%, in August. It is worth noting that the growth in the unemployment rate this year, in comparison to last year, is due to the 4% increase of the Economically Active Population (PEA), in comparison to the average of the same period in 2001, and the increase of 2.7% in the number of employed workers, using the same basis of comparison. Regarding legally registered employment, according to the Ministry of Labor, there was a 0.7% growth in September and a 3.1% growth accumulated in the year, which means the creation of 987 thousand new jobs. 
The current account of the Balance of Payments registered a surplus of US$ 1.2 billion in September of 2002, the best monthly result ever registered. This performance reflects, in part, the US$ 2.5 billion record trade surplus. The performance of services and the income accounts also contributed to this result, with net remittances of US$ 1.5 billion, below the US$ 1.9 billion monthly average in the year, up to August. 
In the first three weeks of October, the trade balance surplus totaled US$ 1.1 billion, with average daily exports of US$ 269 million, in comparison to US$ 233 million for the year. The average daily imports in October, US$ 187 million, is 0.7% below the average observed year-to-date, considering the period from January to October 20. As a result, the accumulated surplus reached US$ 9 billion in 2002, in comparison to the US$ 1.3 billion in the same period of 2001. Exports reached US$ 47.3 billion and imports US$ 38.3 billion, declining by 0.3% and 17.1%, respectively, in comparison to the same period of 2001. 
In summary, economic activity stayed relatively steady in the third quarter of the year, despite the volatility observed in the financial market. In spite of the inventory adjustments that occurred in August and September, the continuing uncertainties of the current scenario may restrain recovery movements in the short term. 
In spite of the recent improvement in the international financial markets, concerns about the financial health of the largest banks and of large European corporations maintain risk aversion and the volatility in the global market. The prospects of recovery of the world economy worsened with the release of the latest economic indicators, reinforcing expectations that a new cycle of recession is on its way. The terrorist attack in Indonesia contributed to increase these worries, and they may affect economic growth in the Southeast Asian countries. The tension in the oil market remains due to the possibility of an attack by the United States on Iraq. 
The macroeconomic indicators continue to show contradictory signs in the United States, casting doubt on the capacity of the economy to recover. 
The businessmen expectation indicators show diverging trends, with an increase in the services indicator and a drop in manufacturing production. Consistent with these results, the index of leading indicators of the Conference Board declined slightly by 0.2% in September, the fourth consecutive month of decline, a fact that had not been repeated since the beginning of the recession of 1990/91. Industrial production declined for the second consecutive month, and the level of utilization of installed capacity, in September , was the lowest, since May. The trade deficit – goods and services - reached US$38.5 billion in August, accumulating a US$ 387 billion negative result in 12 months. 
In Japan, industrial production has been increasing slightly, positively influenced by the exports sector, although domestic demand continues to be poor. However, the unemployment rate continues static at a high relative level, 5.4% in August, and the chronic problems, such as deflation and the fragility of the banking credit, continue without solution. 
The economy of the Euro area does not register consistent signs of recovery either. Retail sales increased in July and industrial production increased by 0.6% in August. However, the main indicators of confidence indicated a declining expectation of both consumers and businessmen. The unemployment rate remained stable at 8.3% in August, and the annual inflation, measured through the Harmonized Consumer Price Index, reached 2.1% in September, above the ceiling of 2% defined by the European Central Bank (ECB). 
The inflation rate in September indicated an increase in prices, especially in free prices, mainly as a consequence of the evolution of the exchange rate. The Consumer Price Index - Extended (IPCA) increased by 0.72%, compared to the 0.65% increase in August, accumulating a 5.6% variation in the year and a 7.9% variation in 12 months. In the General Price Index - Demand Supply (IGP-DI), the effects of the exchange rate depreciation and off-season period were stronger due to the impact of the agricultural and industrial prices on the Wholesale Price Index (IPA). 
The monthly result of the Consumer Price Index - Extended (IPCA) was influenced by a 1.96% rise in food and beverage prices, mainly due to the influence of the behavior of the exchange rate on soy oil and wheat and meat by-product prices. The increase in non-food product prices showed an acceleration, with a variation of 0.37%, contrasting with the 0.29% increase last month. The price increase in this group also bears evidence of the influence of the exchange rate variation: electro electronic devices, personal hygiene and cleaning materials. The products with monitored prices presented a monthly variation of - 0.01%, compared with a 0.22% increase in August, as a result of the 7.61% decline in the prices of bottled gas, which offset the price increases with a smaller impact in many other items, such as water and sewage, electricity and posting services. 
In the IGP-DI, the Wholesale Price Index - Demand Supply (IPA-DI) rose by 3.84% in the month, reflecting the increases of 5.86% in agricultural prices and 3.04% in industrial prices. Among the agricultural components, the increase in the prices of wheat, corn, rice, coffee, soy, cotton, poultry and cattle for slaughter should be highlighted. Among the industry components, the upward movement in prices affected mainly the metallurgical and mechanical segments, paper and cardboard, textiles, chemical and food products. 
In October the exchange rate depreciation in all likelihood will continue to be the main source of inflationary pressure on prices, a factor which associated to the increase of monitored prices – (mainly, as a result of the increase of fares of urban transport in Rio and the increase of airline fares)- plus the height of the off-season period, especially considering the delay in the rainy season, will imply in the maintenance of inflation rates at high levels. 
On September 17, on the eve of the release of Copom’s decision in that month’s meeting, the spread between the Over-Selic target and the 1-year interest rate was of 710 p.b. Afterwards, the 1-year spread reached 1,182 b.p., on October 11. After the release of the minutes of the nonscheduled Copom meeting, on October 16, the spread fell to 976 b.p.. The interest rates continued to show a declining trend due to the reduction of the uncertainties regarding the political-economic scenario in 2003 and the spread reached 787 b.p. on October 22. 
A total of US$6.6 billion in securities and exchange rate swaps matured between September 18 and October 22, and the rollover rate reached 37%. Due to the lower demand for exchange rate hedge and the high rates proposed, the Banco Central decided not to rollover the US$150 million maturing on September 20, and the US$1.5 billion maturing on the 25th of the same month. Regarding the US$1.3 billion maturity on October 1, the rollover rate reached only 20%, with a maximum limit previously set at 70%. Banco Central did not set a ceiling for the rollover of US$3.6 billion due on October 17, when the reference value of the contracted swaps reached US$2.2 billion (59% of the maturities). 
In the same period, the National Treasury carried out three auctions of National Treasury Bills (LTN), in which the total offer was limited to 500 thousand securities per event, distributed between LTN maturing in November or December 2002, and LTN maturing in January 2003. Only lower tenure securities were placed, amounting to R$1.5 billion. Due to the increase of the demand for National Treasury Financial Bills (LFT) in October, the National Treasury resumed selling these securities in the weekly auctions, which had not occurred since the beginning of August. On October 8, 500 thousand securities maturing in December 2002 were offered. In the following week, when the National Treasury auctioned only LFT, the first offer of 500 thousand securities was not enough to cover the demand, thus the National Treasury made a new offer of 1 million securities. The offer increased to 2 million securities on October 22. On all these occasions LFT were placed, and regarding the auctions on October 15 and 22, when securities maturing in 2002 and 2003 were offered, those with lower tenure were sold with premium. The financial result of the LFT placement reached R$5.8 billion, of which R$2.9 billion will mature in 2003. 
A high increase of the demand for National Treasury Note-C Series (NTN-C) with three-year tenure was also observed, leading the National Treasury to offer these securities more frequently. Five auctions were carried out, totaling R$4.5 billion. 
Aiming at reducing the volatility of LFT prices, Banco Central carried out twelve selling auctions of LFT maturing in 2003, with a total value of R$3.1 billion, allowing the settlement to be carried out with LFT and LFT-B maturing between 2004 and 2006. A further thirteen auctions were carried out to repurchase R$4.7 billion of LFT maturing in 2003. 
Banco Central do Brasil intervened in the open market, withdrawing and providing one day liquidity, during the twenty-four working days between September 19 and October 22. The rates were, respectively, 17.90% and 18.00% to withdraw and provide liquidity, up to October 14. After the increase of the Over-Selic interest rate target, these rates increased to, respectively, 20.90% and 21.00%. The average daily volumes in the actions to reduce or increase liquidity were of R$33.7 billion and R$4.3 billion, respectively. The Banco Central also carried out two long-term selling operations with repurchase agreement, with a total financial value of R$6.9 billion and an average tenure of approximately 24 working days. 
Considering the financial settlements between September 19 and October 22, there was an expansionist monetary impact of R$31.1 billion, basically due to the net redemptions of R$17.6 billion in LFT and of R$15.0 billion in exchange rate-linked securities. 
In September, despite the net redemption of securities totaling R$17.9 billion, the domestic federal securitized debt increased by R$36.0 billion (5.8%), mainly due to the exchange rate depreciation. 
The identified shocks and their impacts were assessed according to newly available information. The scenario considered in the simulations encompasses the following assumptions: 
1. There is a high level of uncertainty about the trend of future prices of petroleum by-products. In the last Copom meeting many alternative scenarios were analyzed. A conservative scenario forecasts gasoline price increases of approximately 9% for the rest of 2002 and a further 9% in 2003. The price of bottled gas is forecast to increase 16.6% in the last quarter and a further 16.6% increase is estimated for 2003. The revision of the readjustments for the petroleum by-products is a result of the pass-though occurred due to the increase in the international petroleum price that took place in the last months and to the exchange rate variation that has happened since the last readjustments. As always, in the event of changes to these parameters, the forecasts will be reviewed. 
2. For the readjustment of the residential electricity tariffs, an increase of 21.2% in 2002 is projected, of which 3.8% still to occur from October to December. The value projected in October is slightly higher than the one projected in September. For 2003, the forecast for the readjustment of the electricity tariffs increased to 25% in October from 21% in September, as a consequence of the exchange rate depreciation. 
3. Regarding the set of prices administered by contracts and monitored, whose weighting represented 31.3% in the IPCA in September, the inflation forecast for 2002 grew by 2.4 p.p. in relation to the last Copom meeting, to 11.6%. The latter increase in the projection is due to the exchange rate pass-through. For 2003, the inflation forecast for the prices administered by contracts and monitored is 12.1%, therefore, above the 7.9% forecast in September. The revision of the projection for 2003 is a consequence of the exchange rate depreciation and the increase in the IGP-M projection for 2003, which incorporates the forecasts of some relevant readjustments of prices administered by contracts and monitored. 
4. The estimate of the 6-month spread over the Selic rate is based on an error correction model specification. Maintaining the Selic rate constant at 21.0% p.a., the projection for the 6-month spread starts at 640 p.b. in the fourth quarter of 2002, declining afterwards, to reach -90 p.b. at the end of 2003.
The monthly inflation rate measured by the IPCA reached 0.72% in September, a higher value in comparison to 0.65% in August. The core inflation of the IPCA, calculated under the symmetric trimmed-mean method, grew to 0.78% in September from 0.65% in August. In the last twelve months, this core registered a variation of 7.40%. In its turn, the core inflation of the Consumer Price Index - Brazil (IPC-BR), calculated under the symmetric trimmed-mean method, increased to 0.67% in September from 0.65% in August. In twelve months, this core registered a variation of 6.87%. The core inflation calculated by excluding prices administered by contracts and household food prices registered a variation of 0.61% in September, an accumulated variation of 6.49% over twelve months. 
The accumulated IPCA variation over twelve months, which had been presenting a declining trend since May, registered 7.93% in September, a value above the ones observed in the last four months. In these twelve months, the free market prices contributed to the inflation with 4.95 p.p., while the prices administered by contracts and monitored contributed with 2.98 p.p. 
Regarding the fiscal policy, the hypothesis assumed is to achieve a 3.88% primary surplus for the consolidated public sector this year and 3.75% for the coming years. The other related assumptions established in the previous meeting were maintained. 
From the simulation exercises with several specifications of the structural model, it has been concluded that the maintenance of the interest rate at 21.0% p.a. and the exchange rate at the same level as on the eve of the Copom meeting (R$3.90) indicates an inflation rate considerably above the upper limit of the tolerance interval in 2002 and around the upper limit of the target in 2003. 
The economic indicators have been reinforcing the scenario shown in September, of growing sales and stable industrial production. Preliminary seasonally adjusted data of the Fecomercio shows a 2.4% increase of the real turnover of the retail commerce in São Paulo in September, the second consecutive monthly increase. The enquiries to the SPC and Usecheque increased by 3.5%, compared to August. According to seasonally adjusted data of the IBGE, the real payroll increased by 1.15% between June and July. For August, the available data refers to industrial activity, surveyed by the CNI, and they show that, compared to July, the employment level remained stable and the payroll declined by 0.6%. Since the positive evolution of the earnings is inclined to be more closely related to the growing levels of occupation, rather than to the increase of their average earnings, an eventual increase of consumption should find itself concentrated in the non-durable goods sector, as has been happening. 
The industrial production measured by the IBGE grew by 0.27% between July and August (seasonally adjusted data), confirming the prospects of stability previously outlined by the Copom. The different rates between sales and production levels led to a decline of the inventory levels. According to the CNI, the index that measures the desirable inventory levels of final products in the manufacturing reached 51.7 between the second and third quarters of this year, in comparison to 55.9, the highest value of this series, which started in 1999. According to this index, data above 50 signify higher than desired inventories. In spite of the low level of utilization of the production capacity and the salary stability, the cost rises derived from the exchange rate depreciation should exert pressure on inflation, even if the current level of consumption is maintained. 
The strong exchange rate depreciation and the slow growth of the economy have been causing a fast adjustment in the current account of the Balance of Payments. The 12-month accumulated deficit has been declining since July 2001, reaching US$ 13 billion in September, after surpluses in two consecutive months. The improvement of the current account, which registered the highest surplus (US$1.22 billion) in the last ten years in September, is attributed mainly to the good performance of the trade balance, whose 12-month accumulated result reached US$ 9.2 billion in September, from US$ 3 billion at the beginning of this year. A deficit of up to US$ 11 billion for the current account is projected for 2002, and a trade surplus of the same amount. For next year, a US$ 9 billion deficit for the current account is projected, and a US$ 15 billion surplus for the trade balance. The exchange rate, however, continues under pressure. Since the Copom meeting of September, the US$ quotation increased to approximately R$3.90 from R$ 3.20, reflecting an environment that is risk averse and a decline of confidence not only in relation to Brazil, but also to the industrialized countries. 
The confidence crisis derived from the uncertainties concerning the future guidance of the economic policy reduced credits to Brazil. Furthermore, the scandals related to big US corporations, the crises observed in emerging markets, the prospects of another war in the Gulf and the reduction of the likelihood of recovery of the US and European economies have been reducing the market’s tolerance to risk. A series of indicators have been showing the increase in the risk perception, to levels comparable to those observed during the Russian crisis. The high correlation between the Embi+ Brazil and S& P 500 indices show that the increase of the country risk registered in the last months is partially due to the higher risk aversion observed in the international financial markets. 
In the last week there was a stabilization and recovery in the financial market. After a depreciation of about 18% between the September meeting and the extraordinary meeting called in October, the real remained relatively stable, at around R$ 3.90, until Copom’s more recent monthly meeting. Furthermore, the country-risk measured by the Embi+ registered a declining trend in the period (2251 b.p. and 1987 b.p. on October 11 and 21, respectively), and one observed a higher demand for public securities in the domestic market, with lower offered discounts.
The inflation expectations surveyed by the Investor Relations Group (Gerin) of the Banco Central do Brasil for 2003 increased during the last month. Since the Copom meeting of September, the expectations' median rose to 5.9% from 5.2% on the eve of the extraordinary meeting of October, and reached 7.0% on the eve of the more recent meeting. There was also an increase in the dispersion of expectations, with the standard deviation reaching 2.7 p.p. on October 21 from an average of 1.2 p.p. in September. The increase of the inflation measured by other indices, as the 2.81% registered on the 2nd preliminary result of the IGP-M of October, contributed to the increase of inflation expectations. 
The Copom also made an upward readjustment in the inflation projections for 2002 and 2003. The exchange rate depreciation was the main factor responsible for this revision. The exchange rate depreciation has direct impacts, increasing free and administered prices, and indirect ones, elevating the inflation expectations and the effects of inertia. Amongst the goods whose prices are administered by contracts and monitored, the projected increases for gasoline and bottled gas is noticeable. Since the meeting of September, the projected inflation for all the administered by contracts and monitored prices in 2003 increased to 12.1% from 7.9%. The new projections point to an IPCA increase around the adjusted target for 2003. 
At this point, it is worth reinforcing the understanding regarding some basic principles that have guided Copom’s actions since the adoption of the inflation target regime. First, the Copom acts by starting with an evaluation of the future trend of inflation. These projections are obtained through the best available information, both quantitative, processed by structural models, simulations and other statistical procedures, and qualitative and disaggregated, which require a more subjective evaluation. 
Second, the Copom tries to analyze the cause of eventual differences between the projection and the target, in order to react in accordance with the recommendations of the best international theory and practices on this matter. It is necessary, at this point, to distinguish between demand and supply shocks, and permanent and temporary shocks. 
Demand shocks should be offset by a policy with an inverse sign to the shock. In the case of a supply shock (also known as a cost-shock) the traditional recommendation has been followed: the direct impact on the price level is accommodated (that is, it does not provoke reaction of the monetary policy), but the secondary (or inertial) effects of the shock are fought. The monetary policy has been adjusted in order to extend the period of convergence of the price index to the inflation target when confronted with shocks of great magnitude, as in the last 18 months. This procedure takes into account the costs (in terms of the product) of the adjustment process, linked to the existence of inflationary inertia. Such a policy indicates that, according to the conception of the targets system, Banco Central should give due consideration to the volatility of the activity level in its decision-making, but without setting aside its main objective of achieving the inflation targets. 
For the Banco Central to be able to act with the necessary flexibility, without losing credibility in its commitment to the targets, it is essential that its performance be totally transparent. To meet this condition, the Copom created a methodology (detailed in the Inflation Report of June 2002) to measure the primary effect of the shocks and the impact of the inertia inherited from the previous period. Furthermore, in view of the magnitude and of the persistence of the shock, the Copom evaluates the time period necessary to eliminate the inflationary inertia. Given this period, one estimates the part of the inertia to be tolerated in the year under consideration and, added to which the estimate of the primary shock, is incorporated in the target, for the purpose of comparison with Copom’s target projection. For example, for next year, the sum of half the impact of the inflationary inertia and of the primary shock of administered prices totals 2 p.p., and increases the adjusted inflation target to a rate of around 6%. In this case, the monetary policy has been set to neutralize the effect of the inertia over two years, assuring, in the absence of other shocks, a gradual convergence of the inflation to the intended target.

29/11/2002;78;Arminio Fraga;"The indicators of the level of activity showed a recovery between the third and fourth quarters. Part of this behavior was due to a continuation of the effects of disbursements from the Time in Service Guarantee Fund (FGTS) on the consumption of semi and non-durable goods, to the increase in earnings in the agricultural sector, and to the acceleration of export growth, as well as of the import-substitution process. More recently, there was an improvement in consumer confidence, and the demand for durable goods was boosted by sectoral promotions.
In retail commerce, preliminary seasonally adjusted data from São Paulo State’s Federation of Commerce (Fecomércio-SP) point to a 0.1% increase in the retail sector’s real revenues in the Metropolitan region of São Paulo in October. The largest increases were observed in the sales of semi and non-durable consumption goods, and cars. October sales grew 4.1% compared to the same month of 2001. The national survey carried out by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) also showed a recovery of retail sales in recent months. 
The improved performance of car sales registered by the Fecomércio-SP is confirmed by data from the National Federation of Auto Distributors (Fenabrave), which registered a 9.2% increase in sales in September, in the seasonally adjusted series. Car dealers’ sales increased a further 2.5% in October, as a result of the promotions started by the reduction of the Industrialized Products Tax (IPI) on vehicles. 
The favorable performance of the retail sector appears set to continue, considering the factors affecting expectations and defaults. Consumer confidence improved in November, according to a survey of the Fecomércio-SP. The Federation’s Consumer Intentions Index (ICC) increased by 5.95% to reach 101.7 points on a scale ranging from 0 to 200. The increase in the ICC resulted from an improvement in consumers’ expectations about the future, which brought the level of the future intentions index close to the series’ peak. The perception of an improvement in the political scenario was the main factor underlying this result, together with a decline in concerns about higher unemployment. With respect to current intentions, the increase was more modest and the index still remains at a low level (81.2), consistent with the perception that the current economic situation remains unfavorable. 
Regarding defaults, the São Paulo Trade Association’s (ACSP) Usecheque indicator decreased to 4.4% in October from 6.7% in September. It should be highlighted that this decline resulted from both a smaller number of new default registrations and the maintenance of a high number of cancelled default registrations. The number of returned checks due to insufficient funds as a share of cleared checks continued to decline, falling to 4.6% in October, compared to the peak of 5.5% in this series registered in March 2002. 
The default rate in financial institutions’ credit portfolio of freely allocated resources remained steady in October at 7.9%, the lowest value since November of last year. The declining trend in defaults, especially on credits to individuals, is due to banks’ selectivity in providing credit in recent months, as well as to the use of disbursements from the Time in Service Guarantee Fund (FGTS), which were freed because of an agreement to settle liabilities. The average interest rate on fixed income credit operations increased 2 p.p. in October, following the increase of the Selic target by the same amount. 
Outstanding credit operations contracted by corporations with freely established rates declined 3.5% in the last month to R$137 billion. The volume of resources with domestic and external funding decreased 1.9% and 6.3%, respectively, despite the growth of 2.1% in the operations of Anticipated Exchange Rate Contracts (ACC), which are determined by the demands of agricultural business. The volume of credit to private individuals totaled R$77 billion, rising by 0.3% in October. Due to the different number of working days, 23 in October compared to 21 in September, the total accumulated disbursements increased by 7.1% in the last month, whereas the daily average of new concessions declined by 4.3%. 
The behavior of general investment indicators continued to show a declining trend, reflecting the carryover effect of the election process on new investment decisions. However, the production of material used in civil construction registered an improvement for the second consecutive month. 
Industrial production increased by 0.9% in September on a seasonally adjusted basis, according to data from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), mainly due to a 1.4% expansion in the transformation industry, while the mineral extraction industry registered a decline of 2.8%. The performance of the metal-mechanical industry, stimulated by the automobile sector, was a key component of the positive result. The transportation material group, in which vehicle production, metallurgy and mechanics have a heavy weight, registered increases of 8.1%, 1.5% and 2.1%, respectively, on a seasonally adjusted basis. The large increase in vehicle sales in August and September favored the stock adjustments in the sector and the expansion of production. This result was also repeated in October, as mentioned before. The furniture sector was also important in the September results, posting an increase of 8.6%. This sector has also shown a significant expansion in recent months stimulated among other factors by an increase in exports. Another important contribution to industrial performance in recent months has been the growth of sales to the agricultural sector - especially agricultural machines and fertilizers. 
Data from the National Confederation of Industries (CNI) on the performance of the industrial sector in September showed an increase in industrial sales for the fourth consecutive month on a seasonally adjusted basis. This increase was due mostly to external sales. According to CNI, between the second and the third quarters of 2002 stocks of raw materials increased slightly, while stocks of final goods fell significantly relative to the levels desired by businesses. This reduction in the stocks of final goods helps to explain the difference between the expansion of industrial sales and industrial production in the third quarter of the year. 
In the labor market, the average open unemployment rate measured by the IBGE increased to 7.5% in September, from 7.3% in August, as a result of a 0.2% fall in the number of employed workers and a 0.1% increase in the Economically Active Population (PEA). According to the Ministry of Labor, in September legally registered employment grew by 0.7% from the previous month on a seasonally adjusted basis, and by 3.7% over the past 12 months. 
With respect to the external accounts, from November 1 to the 17 the trade balance surplus totaled US$816 million, with average daily exports of US$273 million, in comparison to US$238 million for the year. November’s average daily imports of US$192 million are 1.7% higher than the average observed year-to-date, considering the period from January to November 17. As a result, the accumulated trade surplus in the year-to-date reached US$10.9 billion, in comparison to the US$1.7 billion in the same period of 2001. Exports reached US$52.7 billion, 2% higher than in the same period of 2001, while imports reached US$41.8 billion, 16.2% below the corresponding figure last year.
In summary, economic activity is showing signs of increasing dynamism, associated with the growth in sales of consumer goods with lower unit values since the beginning of the second half of the year – and attributable, among other factors, to the extraordinary resources coming from the FGTS, to the expansion of exports and import substitution, to sales directed to the agricultural sector and to the recent increase in sales of durable goods, especially vehicles. Going forward, the adjustment in stocks observed in the industrial sector, the relatively low level of defaults, and the recovery in both consumer and business confidence are elements that should contribute to a continuation of this process of recovery. 
The international economic scenario has changed little in recent weeks and remains adverse for emerging economies. Capital flows are still being influenced by risk aversion and the high volatility of financial asset prices, which has resulted in part from weaker-than-expected corporate results. Expectations for a recovery of the global economy have declined due to the release of the latest economic indicators, which have strengthened forecasts that a new recessionary period may be in course, particularly after the terrorist attack in Indonesia and with the possibility of a United States attack on Iraq. 
In the United States, macroeconomic indicators are still sending contradictory signals, increasing concerns regarding prospects for an economic recovery. At its last meeting, the Federal Reserve decreased the basic interest rate by 50 points, to 1.25% p.a., and withdrew the downward bias, signaling that the easing cycle may have ended. On this point it should be highlighted that there is increasing concern among academics about the imminence of a deflationary cycle that would make monetary policy ineffectual in stimulating the economy. The FED’s recent actions indicate that it may believe that recent outcomes are much more the result of very large productivity gains than excessive weakness in demand, justifying its recent monetary easing. Indicators of business and consumer confidence registered large declines in recent months, reflecting increasing uncertainties over the prolonged cycle of financial market losses and the labor market slow down, and increased fears regarding new terrorist attacks and the imminent military action against Iraq. 
In Japan, the recovery of GDP growth was verified in the third quarter. However, a new deceleration is expected in the final months of the year. The uncertainty regarding global economic growth and the drop in demand for information technology-intensive goods has impacted Japan’s export performance in recent months, transferring to internal demand the burden of sustaining economic activity. The unemployment rate has stabilized at a high level (5.4% from August to October) and the country is still waiting for the implementation of structural reforms to overcome deflation and the fragility of the banking system. 
The performance of economic activity in the countries of the euro area has been worse than the results observed in the USA, causing forecasts for a more broad-based recovery to be abandoned. The economic situation in Germany appears worse than in the other countries of the region, including in the areas of economic activity, the fiscal accounts and the results of the banking system, and due to the country’s importance, it has been influencing the euro area’s overall results and investor expectations. The maintenance of the basic interest rate of the region indicated the European Central Bank’s (ECB) concern with inflation, which stood at an annual rate of 2.3% in October, the third month that inflation has remained above the ECB’s target of 2.0% p.a.. This decision about the interest rate, in turn, contributed to the continuity of the euro’s appreciation, with the exchange rate once again surpassing US dollar parity in recent days. 
The inflation rate showed a significant acceleration in October, mainly reflecting the evolution of the exchange rate. The Consumer Price Index - Extended (IPCA) increased by 1.31%, accumulating a 6.98% increase in the year to October and a 8.45% variation in 12 months. Due to the impact of agricultural and industrial prices on wholesale prices, the effects of the exchange rate depreciation, recent increases in the international prices of some commodities, and the impact of the off-season period on agricultural prices were even more notable in the General Price Index - Demand Supply (IGP-DI). The monthly variation in the IGP-DI increased to 4.21% in October, from 2.64% in September, accumulating an increase of 16.3% in the year to October and 17.4% in 12 months. 
The significant rise of the IPCA was due to the continuation of increases in free prices and to the impact of hikes in some monitored prices. The increase in free prices was responsible for 0.98 percentage points of the monthly variation and was mainly a consequence of pressure from food prices linked to the exchange rate, such as cattle meat, French roll, chicken, soy oil and rice. Among non-food products, prices of electronic devices, clothing, cigarettes, furniture and personal hygiene products posted the largest increases. Monitored prices contributed 0.33 percentage points to the monthly variation of the IPCA, reflecting increases in the prices of alcohol, gasoline, airline fares, health insurance and urban transportation in Rio de Janeiro. 
Within the IGP-DI, the Wholesale Price Index –(IPA) rose 6.02% in October as a result of an 8.65% increase in agricultural prices and a 4.96% in industrial prices. Among the agricultural components, increases in the prices of soy, coffee beans, cattle meat, eggs, rice, poultry, wheat and corn were most notable. In the industrial components, price hikes were most notable mainly in metallurgical products, mineral extracting, electrical parts, paper, cardboard, chemical and food products. The National Civil Construction Index (INCC), also a sub-index of the IGP-DI, rose 1.13% in October, primarily reflecting a 1.79% increase in the costs of building materials such as steel, tile, cement, ironware and wood. 
The exchange rate depreciation in recent months will continue to produce strong pressure on prices. This fact, combined with the impact of increases occurring in administered prices like fuel (gasoline, diesel and bottled gas) and electric energy (in Rio de Janeiro), will put upward pressure on consumer price indices again in November, with the possibility of a reversal only from the following month on. 
The spread between the Over Selic target and the 1-year interest rate, which stood at 787 b.p. on October 22, increased to 1,139 b.p. on November 13, its highest level since the October Copom meeting, before declining to 1,045 b.p. at the end of the period on November 19. The increase in the slope of the yield curve was caused by the rise in inflationary pressure and uncertainties about the exchange rate and the country's risk behavior, amongst other factors. 
Between October 23 and November 19, Banco Central carried out ten auctions of Fx swaps contracts for the rollover of US$6.1 billion of Fx-linked securities and Fx swaps. The rollover of these instruments reached 82% or US$5.0 billion, with maturities on newly issued swaps ranging between 1 month and two years. 
In the same period, the National Treasury carried out four auctions, placing R$21.1 billion in LFTs with an average tenor of 128 days. LTNs were offered at just one of these auctions. The attractiveness of the yield on LFTs maturing in the beginning of 2003, and the stabilization of the price discount for LFTs across all maturities due to the Banco Central’s exchange and repurchase program, explain the increase in demand for these securities noted since October. On the other hand, concerns about a possible increase in the Selic rate target reduced interest in fixed income securities, resulting in no placements of LTNs in the period. Placements of NTN-Cs reached R$4.1 billion. 
Continuing the program to reduce LFT price volatility, the Banco Central carried out ten selling auctions of securities maturing in 2003, allowing settlement to be carried out with LFTs and LFT-Bs maturing from 2004 to 2006. In addition, Banco Central carried out nine purchase auctions of LFTs maturing in 2003. The former auctions totaled R$1.1 billion, while the latter withdrew the equivalent of R$0.3 billion in securities from the market. In both cases, decreasing interest in the auctions has been observed, consistent with the already mentioned increase in market interest for LFTs. 
Banco Central do Brasil intervened in the open market on a daily basis between October 24 and November 19, withdrawing and providing one day liquidity at respective yields of 20.90% p.a. and 21.00% p.a. The average daily volumes of the auctions to reduce and increase liquidity were R$40.2 billion and R$4.2 billion, respectively. 
The financial settlements between October 24 and November 19 had an expansionary monetary impact of R$3.0 billion, resulting from net placements of LFTs (R$14.0 billion) and NTN-Cs (R$6.2 billion) and net redemptions of LTNs (R$13.6 billion) and exchange rate indexed securities (R$9.7 billion). 
In October, the domestic federal securitized debt declined by R$26.7 billion (4.1%), due mainly to the appreciation of the exchange rate and the net redemption of R$27.1 billion in securities. 
The identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available information. The scenario considered in the simulations assumes the following hypotheses: 
1. As mentioned in previous releases, the forecasts for the price readjustments of petroleum by-products are based on the changes in international petroleum prices and the exchange rate since the last readjustment. Because of the exchange rate appreciation that has occurred since the price readjustment announced in the beginning of November and the decrease in the international price of petroleum and its by-products, there was a downward revision to the forecasted values for 2003. For gasoline, a decrease of about 1.5% was forecast, in comparison to the increase of 9% forecast at the last Copom meeting. For bottled gas, the price is forecast to increase by approximately 6%, a much smaller increase than was projected at the ordinary meeting in October. For the last two months of 2002, the prices of gasoline and bottled gas are projected to remain stable, based on the values announced by Petrobras on November 1st. 
2. Regarding electricity tariffs, an increase of 20% is forecasted for 2002, of which 17.2% already occurred between January and October. This value is lower than the forecast at the last meeting and this revision is a result of the exchange rate appreciation observed in the period. The projection of the electricity readjustment for 2003 increased to 27% in November from 25% in October, as a consequence of the increase in the projections for the IGP-M index, which has a significant impact on the readjustments of electricity prices. 
3. The set of prices administered by contracts and monitored was redefined, and now excludes charcoal, school transportation and housekeepers' wages. Considering the new definition, the weight of the prices administered by contracts and monitored in the IPCA stood at 27.7% in October, instead of 31.1%. According to this new definition, the forecasts for these prices came to 13.4% and 12.1% for 2002 and 2003, respectively, in comparison to the 12.0% and 12.7% projected previously. The lower 2003 projection for the inflation of the prices administered by contracts and monitored is due mainly to the new projection for petroleum by-products. 
4. The forecast for the spread of the 6-month interest rate over the Selic rate, which utilizes a model specification based on the error correction method of estimation, and which assumes the maintenance of the Selic rate at a constant 21.0% p.a., starts at 490 b.p. in the fourth quarter of 2002, and, afterwards, shows a declining trend up to -100 b.p. at the end of 2003. 
The monthly inflation rate measured by the IPCA reached 1.31% in October, higher than the 0.72% increase in September and above the projection at the October Copom meeting. Core inflation of the IPCA, calculated under the symmetric trimmed-mean method, remained at 0.78% in October. In the last twelve months, core prices registered an increase of 7.62%. In its turn, the core inflation of the Consumer Price Index - Brazil (IPC-BR), calculated under the symmetric trimmed-mean method, increased to 0.97% in October, from 0.67% in September. In twelve months, core prices of the IPC-BR registered an increase of 7.30%. Core inflation calculated by excluding prices administered by contracts and household food prices registered a variation of 0.74% in October, and an accumulated variation of 6.75% over twelve months. 
The accumulated IPCA variation over twelve months, which had been presenting a declining trend from May to August, registered increases in September (7.93%) and October (8.44%). In these twelve months, free market prices contributed 5.47 p.p. to inflation, while prices administered by contracts and monitored contributed 2.98 p.p. 
Regarding fiscal policy, it was assumed that the consolidated public sector achieves a 3.88% of GDP primary surplus for this year and 3.75% for the coming years. The other related assumptions established in the previous meeting were maintained. 
From the simulation exercises with several specifications of the structural model, it has been concluded that the maintenance of the interest rate at 21.0% p.a. and the exchange rate at the same level as on the eve of the Copom meeting (R$3.55) indicates an inflation rate above the upper limit of the tolerance interval in 2002 and 2003. 
Economic activity has started to show signs of recovery, led by the increase in consumption and net exports observed in recent months. Preliminary data from Fecomércio show that the Sao Paulo retail sector’s real revenues remained basically stable in October (seasonally-adjusted data), but were up 12.5% relative to October 2001. Reflecting in part the proximity of year-end festivities and the improvement of expectations about the future government, in November the IIC increased by almost 6% in relation to the previous month, mainly due to an increase in its future intentions component. According to seasonally adjusted data from CNI, real industrial sales have been rising since May, and in the most recent monthly comparison for September increased by 1.7%. 
The monthly change in industrial production measured by IBGE has been positive since June. In the last three months, the growth rate has increased, rising to 0.9% in September from 0.13% in July (seasonally-adjusted data). In line with the industrial production results, the Pimes survey, carried out by the IBGE, shows an increase of 1.3% in industrial employment in September in relation to August, the highest monthly growth rate since the start of the series in December 2000. As mentioned in the Minutes of the Copom’s October meeting, the increase in industrial production in September may be explained by the reaction of industry to the increase in demand and the reduction of inventories, which fell from 53.1 to 48.5 between the second and third quarters of 2002. For the inventory index, figures above 50 correspond to inventories greater than the level desired by the firms. 
The current account of the balance of payments continues to adjust as a consequence of the steep exchange rate depreciation. The projected deficit for 2002 is below US$9 billion. This forecast is due mainly to a projected trade surplus of US$12.5 billion for 2002. For 2003, the projected current account deficit is even lower, at US$8 billion, while the projected trade surplus is US$15 billion. The improvement in the balance of payments and in expectations for the future conduct of economic policy since the Copom’s last meeting allowed the dollar to fall from R$3.90 to R$3.55 in the period. The appreciation of the real was limited to some degree by the risk aversion prevailing in international markets. 
Since the October Copom meeting, there have been other positive results in the financial markets aside from the appreciation of the real. Country-risk measured by the Embi+ declined from 1,987 b.p to 1,655 b.p. between October 21 and November 18. Discounts on the prices of public securities diminished. Public securities were placed with greater ease, and finally, in October the mutual fund industry posted its best results in terms of financial inflows since January 2002. 
However, there was deterioration in inflation expectations for 2003. The median of inflation expectations for 2003 surveyed by the Investor Relations Group of the Banco Central do Brasil rose to 7.0% in October from 5.2% in September and it reached 9.8% on the eve of the most recent meeting. This increase was driven by a number of factors which include: i) a reaction to the deep depreciation of the exchange rate, which reached R$3.96/US$ in October, ii) the disclosure of indices – IGP, IPC-FIPE and IPCA - showing increased inflation in October and November, iii) questions related to the future conduct of monetary policy, and iv) a greater risk of margin recovery and pass-through of the exchange rate depreciation to prices in an environment of economic recovery. 
The Copom has also has also made an upward adjustment to its inflation projections for 2002 and 2003, mainly due to the increase in inflation expectations in the economy. However, Copom's forecasts are meaningfully below the median of market expectations. As there was a reduction in the forecast for the readjustment of administered prices for 2003, to 12.1% from 12.7%, the higher IPCA forecast is due to a higher forecast for inflation in free prices. It is important to highlight that although the inflation forecasts of nearly 100 financial and non-financial institutions surveyed by the Investor Relations Group are a relevant parameter for price formation in the economy, they are not the only source of information used by the Copom to evaluate inflation expectations in the Brazilian economy. Among other factors that were evaluated it should be noted that the October industrial survey of the Getúlio Vargas Foundation (FGV), found that 48% of firms are willing to raise their prices. Also, recent collective wage adjustments were taken into account. 
The Copom focuses on the concept of an adjusted inflation target, in which the target of 4% set for 2003 is adjusted by adding the primary impact of administered price shocks, and half the impact of inflationary inertia inherited from 2002. The adjusted target for 2003 has not changed since October (around 6%). The current inflation forecast is above this value. In summary, in light of the increase in inflation expectations for 2003, as well as the risk of higher passthrough of the exchange rate depreciation to prices, and the fact that the inflation forecast is above the adjusted target, the Copom decided, unanimously, to increase the target for the Selic rate to 22% p.a., with no bias.
"
27/12/2002;79;Arminio Fraga;"In the beginning of the fourth quarter, the evolution of the level of activity followed the trend of gradual growth that has been outlined in the last months. The increase in exports, the favorable results in retail commerce, mainly boosted by the disbursements from the FGTS, and the demand for inputs associated with the expansion of agricultural production are factors that continue to give more dynamism to the economy in the second half of this year. 
According to seasonally adjusted data from Fecomércio, the retail sector’s real revenues in September and October were essentially stable in relation to August, when there was a significant increase in sales in the metropolitan region of São Paulo. Year to date figures point to a 3.8% growth relative to the same period of 2001, with a notable expansion in sales of consumption goods, particularly non-durable goods. The national survey carried out by the IBGE showed a 0.14% fall in the volume of retail sales in the year to October figures, confirming the gradual recovery of the retail sector over the year. 
After posting a sharp increase in October, car sales fell in November, according to seasonally adjusted data from the Fenabrave. The increase in sales in October was driven by a high number of promotions in that month and the prospect of price increases in the following months (since confirmed), and therefore was not repeated. The auto sector was negatively affected this year by the evolution of expectations and credit conditions, and declined by 7.7% in the year to November. The recent recovery observed in consumer expectations is one of the factors that tend to favor sales in the medium term. 
In December, the IIC increased by 5% to reach 106.8 points on a scale ranging from 0 to 200, according to the survey by Fecomércio. The increase in the IIC resulted from an improvement in consumers’ intentions, current and future, and it should be highlighted that the future intentions index reached 120.3, the highest level since the beginning of the series in March 1999. The perception of improvement in the political scenario was the factor that most influenced this result, together with a decline in concerns over a higher unemployment rate. 
Regarding defaults, data from the ACSP show that the number of new default registrations was stable in November as compared to October. The number of cancelled default registrations fell by 7.4% in the same period, but it should be highlighted that this number had been growing significantly between July and October, reflecting liquidation of debts using extraordinary disbursements from the FGTS.
The default rate on financial institutions’ credit portfolio of freely allocated resources remained steady in November at 8%. The percentage of arrears on credits to individuals fell by 0.2 p.p., repeating the performance of the previous month. With respect to credits to corporations, the 0.2 p.p. increase in the percentage of arrears resulted from a few new occurrences with high volumes, and to the fall in the relative participation of on-lending of external resources, with smaller default rates. 
Outstanding credit operations with freely established rates declined by 0.2% in November, the same behavior of the segment of credit lines to corporations. The volume of credit to private individuals remained stable, indicating households’ caution because of the adverse conditions for indebtedness, which have stimulated borrowers to repay liabilities with resources from the FGTS, income tax refunds and the 13th wage. The fall in credit operations to corporations was due to the 4.9% reduction in operations with external funding, since the end-of-month balances of operations funded domestically expanded by 3.7%. 
Investment indicators remain on a downward trend, reflecting the effects of the political transition on business decisions. However, there was an improvement in the production of inputs for civil construction for the third consecutive month, reflecting the recent increase in the demand for construction materials for small renovations and residential enlargements. It should be noted that the recent improvement in the real estate market, reflected in the expansion of the number of new residential and commercial units, will have a positive effect on the production of inputs and on the labor market in the coming months. 
Regarding industrial activity, production registered a 1.7% expansion in October as compared to the previous month on a seasonally adjusted basis. With this latest result, data from the PIM carried out by the IBGE showed industrial growth for the fifth consecutive month on a seasonally adjusted basis. In October, 16 of the 20 groups surveyed posted an expansion, with the highest growth in transportation material, which increased by 19.8% in the last two months on a seasonally adjusted basis. By categories of use, the increase of 4.9% in the production of durable consumption goods and of 4.3% in capital goods should be highlighted. The production of intermediate goods, which has a heavy weighting in the composition of industrial output, maintained the recent trend of gradual growth in the month, registering an increase of 0.8%. With these results, industrial production in the year to October expanded by 1.9%. 
The increased dynamism in industrial activity has been reflected in indicators of installed capacity utilization. Data from the Conjunctural Survey carried out by the Getulio Vargas Foundation show that utilization reached 80.4% in October, as compared to 79% in July and 79.8% in the same month of 2001. This reading, however, is relatively far from the peak of the series, 86%, registered in April 1995. 
In the labor market, the average open unemployment rate measured by the IBGE remained stable in October, at 7.4%, as compared to 7.5% in September. This result was due to a 0.2% fall in the PEA, while the number of employed workers remained stable. According to the Ministry of Labor, in October legally registered employment grew by 0.2% from the previous month on a seasonally adjusted basis, and by 3.6% over the past 12 months. 
With respect to the external accounts, the trade balance continued to show good performance in December, registering a US$662 million surplus up to the second week of the month. Average daily exports reached US$251 million, in comparison to US$238 million for the year. Average daily imports reached US$185 million, 1.9% lower than the figure observed from January to December 15. As a result, the accumulated trade surplus in the year-to-date reached US$11.9 billion, in comparison to the US$1.9 billion in the same period of 2001. Exports reached US$57.6 billion, 2.8% higher than in the same period of 2001, while imports reached US$45.7 billion, 15.6% below the corresponding figure last year. 
The current account of the BoP adjusted strongly in 2002, more sharply in the second half, not only due to the performance of the trade balance, but also because of a reduction in net expenditures on services and income. 
In summary, the observed growth in the level of activity has been a result of the relatively strong performance of retail activity and the significant expansion of the trade balance. Reflecting these factors, industrial activity has been gradually expanding over the second half of this year. For the upcoming months, it is possible to outline a favorable scenario for the continuity of this expansion. The inventory adjustment observed in the industrial sector, the relatively low level of defaults, the prospect for lower commitments of the 13th wage as a result of the disbursements from the FGTS, and the recovery of expectations are contributing factors in this process. 
The international scenario continues to point to a fragile recovery of the world economy, with investment expenditures too low to foster an increase in production. The prospect of moderate growth for the world economy remains in place for 2003, supported by consumption, low inflation and loose monetary and fiscal policies. The confirmation of this view is still subject to potential risks in the short run, including the possibility of an armed conflict between the United States and Iraq, which would destabilize the petroleum market, already affected by the political crisis in Venezuela. The financial markets also remain unstable, with the possibility of further declines due to increased risk perceptions or to the frustration of expectations for corporate profits. 
In the United States of America, the 4% annualized GDP growth in the third quarter was confirmed, supported mainly by private consumption, which increased by 4.2%. Retail sales increased by 0.4% in November, in comparison to October, and excluding automobiles rose by 0.6%. Industrial and commercial inventories and industrial orders increased in October. The labor market remained depressed, with the unemployment rate reaching 6% in November. On the other hand, the productivity of the non-agricultural sector grew 5.1% in the third quarter, keeping unit labor costs unchanged. As of now, inflation remains under control and the Federal Reserve kept the target for the Fed Funds rate at 1.25% p.a.. Confidence indicators show improved business and consumer expectations in November. 
In Japan, revised data show a 3.2% annualized GDP growth in the third quarter, sustained mainly by domestic consumption. Even so, the Bank of Japan recently revised downward the evaluation of the economy for the first time in eleven months, due to external uncertainties and the global deceleration. Export growth has been slowing due to insufficient external demand, mainly on items related to information technology. In October the unemployment rate once again reached 5.5%, repeating the level of December 2001, the highest since the start of the survey in 1953. Annual inflation measured by the IPC was –0.9% in October, while the wholesale price index registered an increase of 0.3%. The Tankan industrial confidence index increased for the third consecutive quarter. 
In the countries of the euro area, the economic stagnation continues, unchanged by the announcement of the 0.8% growth of GDP in the third quarter, in comparison to the same period of the previous year. The recessionary scenario is particularly intense in Germany, the most important economy of the region. The 0.5 p.p. reduction of the basic interest rate by the ECB revealed its concern with this scenario, although the annual rate of inflation increased to 2.3% in October, above the ECB’s target of 2% since August. Confidence indicators remained without a discernible trend in November. Regarding the business sector, confidence indicators in the euro area and of the main economies of the region registered increases, except in Germany. As for indices of consumer expectations, there were positive results in France and Italy, and drops in Germany and in the other regions’ indicators. 
Price indices showed large increases in November, mainly reflecting the effects of the supply shocks - exchange rate depreciation and restriction in the supply of agricultural products - occurring in the second half of 2002. The IPCA increased by 3.02% in November, accumulating a 10.22% increase in the year and a 10.93% increase in 12 months. In the IGP-DI, the effects of these shocks were stronger in wholesale prices, both agricultural and industrial. The monthly increase in the IGP-DI reached 5.84% in November, compared to the 4.21% increase in October, accumulating a 23.09% increase in the year and a 23.31% increase in 12 months. 
Products with monitored prices contributed 1.19 percentage points (a 4.29% increase), while products with free prices contributed 1.83 percentage points (a 2.53% increase) to the 3.02% monthly increase of the IPCA. Among the products with monitored prices, increases in airline tickets and fuel prices should be highlighted. The latter encompasses a pass-through of more than 70% of the refinery price adjustment to consumer prices. Among the products with free prices, tradable goods contributed 1.42 percentage points and non-tradable goods contributed 0.42 percentage points. 
In the IGP-DI, the IPA-DI rose by 7.45% in November mainly due to the acceleration of the increase in industrial prices, which reached 7.05% in the month compared to 4.96% in October. The increase in agricultural prices, although still high at 8.42%, compared to 8.65% in October, showed signs of deceleration and provided prospects for a reversion in the next months’ results. The IPC-BR, the retail price segment of the IGP-DI, rose by 3.14% in the month, compared to 1.14% in October, mainly as a consequence of increases in the prices of food, transport and housing items. The INCC rose by 2.45% in November, compared to a 1.13% rise in October, due mainly to the increase in the prices of construction materials. 
In December, inflation may slow down as a result of smaller pressures due to the evolution of the exchange rate and the exhaustion of the process of food price increases. However, the indices may still show relatively high rates of increase. The rise of monitored prices, although on a decelerating trend, may significantly impact the IPCA in the last month of the year, as a consequence of the residue of the readjustments allowed in November, of the increase of urban bus tariffs (in Curitiba, Brasilia, Goiania and Belem) and of the last correction in fuel prices. 
On the eve of the Copom meeting in November, the spread between the Over-Selic target and the 1-month interest rate was 192 b.p., in line with the expectation of an increase in the target. On the same date, the spread of the 1-year interest rate was 1045 b.p. After the release of the high inflation indices in November, short-term interest rates increased again, while the 1-year interest rate declined as a consequence of the perception of a lower country risk. At the end of the period, on December 17, the short-term and the1-year spreads stood at 253 b.p. and 717 b.p., respectively. 
A total of US$5.9 billion in securities and exchange rate swaps matured from November 20 to December 18. The rollover rate reached 76%, through swap contracts with terms ranging from 2 months to 2 years. The slope of the exchange rate coupon curve declined significantly in the period, although it remains negative. In addition, the curve shifted down across all maturities. This movement was due to increased external funding by financial institutions and to the reduction of uncertainties, allowing significantly lower interest rates in the rollover of exchange rate indexed debt. 
In the same period, the National Treasury carried out four auctions that resulted in the sale of R$25.1 billion in LFTs with an average tenure of 210 days. Both the continuous reduction in these securities’ discount rates and the high liquidity in the market for bank reserves explain the increasing demand for LFTs observed since October. 
Due to the lower demand for IGP-M indexed securities, since the last Copom meeting there was just one 3-year NTN-C auction totaling R$0.7 billion, compared to the total of R$3.8 billion in two auctions in the previous period. In the traditional monthly auction, a total of R$0.9 billion in 5- and 15-year securities was placed. 
Banco Central do Brasil intervened in the open market from November 21 and December 17 on a daily basis, in order to withdraw and provide liquidity. The rates were 22.00% and 21.90% respectively, and the average daily volumes were R$60.6 billion and R$3.4 billion, respectively. 
Considering the financial settlements from November 21 to December 17, there was an expansionary monetary impact of R$8.0 billion, basically due to net redemptions of R$14.5 billion of LTNs, of R$7.8 billion in FX-indexed securities and of R$3.1 billion in NTN-Cs, partially offset by net placements of R$17.9 billion in LFTs. 
In November, the domestic federal securitized debt remained practically stable at R$631.5 billion, compared to R$632.1 billion in October, due to the net redemption of securities totaling R$10.4 billion. 
The identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available information. The scenario considered in the simulations assumes the following hypotheses: 
1. The projections for the prices of petroleum by-products assumed the hypothesis that the rise in international petroleum prices and the exchange rate change observed since the last readjustment would be passed through to domestic prices.. In the case of bottled gas, an increase of 2.0% for the final impact on consumer prices was forecast. For gasoline, a 3.8% decrease is projected for the coming year. It is worth emphasizing that these projections were based on the current values of Cide. In December, the House of Representatives approved an authorization for a maximum readjustment of the Cide charged on gasoline to R$0.86 per liter, from R$0.50, and to R$250.00 per ton, from R$136.70, for bottled gas. The basic scenario does not compute these readjustments, whose direct impact on the IPCA would be around 1 p.p.. 
2. The projections for household electricity tariffs include a 30.3% elevation in 2003. This projection increased by 3.3 p.p. since the last Copom meeting, as a consequence of the revision of the expectations for the IGP-M, an important component in the readjustment criterion for electricity tariffs. For 2002, there was no alteration in relation to the projection released in the Minutes of the Copom meeting of November. 
3. For the set of prices administered by contracts and monitored, which has a 27.7% weight in the November IPCA, increases of 15.4% and 13.04% were projected for 2002 and 2003, respectively. In relation to November projections, there was an increase of 2.0 p.p. for 2002 and of 0.9 p.p. for 2003. For 2004, a 7.6% inflation of prices administered by contracts and monitored was projected, assuming that all these items would follow the variation of the IGP-M in that year. 
4. The projection for the 6-month spread over the Selic rate, which utilizes an error correction based-model specification, starts at 320 b.p. in the first quarter of 2003, and reaches -120 b.p. at the end of that year. 
Core inflation calculated with the exclusion of household food items and administered prices – considering the broadened set of these items and their new definition, which had a 27.7% weight in the November IPCA – registered a 1.17% increase in the month, a significant elevation in comparison to the variations of 0.74% and of 0.61% observed in October and September, respectively. The 12-month accumulated increase in November was 7.35%. Core inflation of the IPC-BR, calculated under the symmetric trimmed-mean method, reached 1.46% in November. In twelve months, this core registered an 8.04% increase. 
The 12-month accumulated increase of the IPCA, which showed a declining trend from May to August, registered increases in September (7.93%), October (8.44%) and November (10.93%). In these last twelve months, free market prices contributed 6.70 p.p. to inflation, while prices administered by contracts and monitored contributed 4.23 p.p.. 
Regarding fiscal policy, it is assumed that the consolidated public sector will achieve the target of a primary surplus of 3.88% of the GDP this year, and of 3.75% for the coming years. The other related assumptions established in the previous meeting were maintained. 
From the simulation exercises with several specifications of the structural model, it has been concluded that the maintenance of the interest rate at 22.0% p.a. and of the exchange rate at a level close to the level on the eve of the Copom meeting (R$3.55) indicates an inflation rate significantly above the upper limit of the tolerance interval in 2003. 
Economic activity shows signs of recovery, with industrial activity showing moderate growth and the retail sector stabilizing at a higher level than usual at the beginning of the year. The maintenance of consumption is mainly due to several conjunctural factors, such as disbursements from the FGTS, the payment of the 13th wage and the improvement of expectations for the future. Industrial production, which increased for the fifth consecutive month in October, is being supported by exports and the mineral extraction industry. 
The remaining disbursements from the FGTS in 2003 will support consumption growth next year. It is worth noting that the disbursements from the FGTS impact aggregate demand. These disbursements produce a reallocation of expenditure to the population with lower purchasing power and, consequently, greater willingness to consume, especially on lower value items. 
The exchange rate remained more stable in the period between the Copom meetings of November and December, but at a depreciated level, which has been helping the rapid adjustment in the balance of payments. Also, there was an improvement in the capital account, with growth in net foreign investment, external funding and commercial financing lines. There was also an improvement in risk perceptions, as suggested by the decline in the domestic interest rate (e.g. FX Coupon) and in the EMBI+ spread. 
However, inflation rates increased significantly in November. The monthly inflation rate measured by the IPCA reached 3.02% in November, higher than in October (1.31%), September (0.72%), and the forecast at the November Copom. Core IPCA inflation, calculated with the symmetric trimmed-mean method, increased to 1.32% in November from 0.78% in September and October. In 12 months to November, this measure of core inflation registered an increase of 8.21%. 
Inflation expectations for 2003 surveyed by the Banco Central do Brasil’s Investor Relations Group (Gerin) increased in the period between the last two Copom meetings, to 11.0% in December from 9.8% in November. Since September, the median of inflation expectations doubled. In the Copom’s view, the factors that could have driven the market to significantly increase inflation expectations for 2003 include: i) the view that there are some economic sectors with repressed exchange rate pass-through, which could lead to pressure on free price inflation in 2003; ii) uncertainties regarding the future conduct of monetary policy; iii) inflation inertia associated with the high inflation registered in the last quarter of 2002. 
The Copom’s inflation forecast for 2003 was also adjusted upward, as a consequence of the inertial effects of the high inflation in the last quarter of 2002, the deterioration of inflation expectations, and the impacts of exchange rate depreciation on administered prices in 2002. 
The Copom considered an alternative scenario in which inflation expectations for 2003 and the exchange rate decline faster. This scenario is based on the recovery of confidence in the Brazilian economy and also on the fact that inflation in the last quarter of 2002 had a strong temporary component. The agricultural off-season, higher prices for some international commodities and preventive price increases are temporary factors that are unlikely to pressure inflation again in the coming months. There are signs, albeit still incipient, such as the Fipe four-week index and the survey of food prices, which show a decline in the speed of price readjustments in the first weeks of December. Moreover, based on the historical average of exchange rate pass-through in Brazil, and the level of inflation in October and November, there is no evidence of restrained exchange rate pass-through still to be realized. 
Nevertheless, in a scenario of deteriorating expectations, rising inflation, and a recovery of economic activity, the probability of price readjustments increases, making the convergence of expectations to a level more consistent with the inflation targets more difficult. 
With this in mind, the Copom believes that an increase in interest rates may inhibit price readjustments, help to coordinate expectations and hinder the deterioration of self-fulfilling inflation expectations. This decision to increase the interest rate will allow the reduction of inflation expectations for 2003.
"
30/01/2003;80;Henrique Meirelles;"The moderate upward trend in the level of economic activity that had been outlined over the second half of the year was sustained at the end of 2002. Key factors supporting the expansion were the increase in exports and import substitution. Domestic consumption was stable in the last two months of the year, although at a relatively high level due to continued support from the extraordinary disbursements from the FGTS. 
According to seasonally adjusted data from Fecomércio, real retail sales in greater São Paulo were roughly stable in December as compared to the previous month, a trend that has been maintained since August, when sales reg-istered remarkable growth. For the year, sales grew 5.1%, with significant expansion in sales of consumption goods, particularly non-durables, reflecting the effects of disbursements from the FGTS on the demand for lower value goods. 
The IIC was stable in January as compared to December, according to the survey by Fecomércio. The index stood at 106.7 points, on a scale ranging from 0 to 200, and consumers’ current and future intentions both remained steady. The relatively high level of the index in December and January can be attributed to the improved political scenario and to reduced concerns over unemployment. 
Regarding default rates, data from the ACSP revealed a significant fall at the end of 2002, repeating this indicator’s seasonal pattern. The number of cancelled default registrations grew by 30% in December, confirming that debtors usually take part of the 13th wage to pay for debts in arrears. Assessing the seasonally adjusted data, the level of default reached 4.2% in December, below the annual average in the last five years. This is partially due to the regu-larization of debtors’ status, reflecting settlements of debts using disbursements from the FGTS. 
Outstanding credit operations with freely established interest rates declined by 0.4% in December, as a result of a 1.2% reduction in credit to individuals, and no change in credit lines to corporations. The volume of new conces-sions grew by 9.8% in the month. This fact is associated with the high volume of renewals in short-term operations to meet the typical demand in this period. 
The fall in outstanding operations to individuals is explained, in addition to the FGTS, by the seasonal payment of debts, mainly those with higher costs, using the 13th wage. In December, balances of overdraft accounts and cred-its for individuals decreased by 5.5% and 2.5% respectively, while acquisition of goods and of vehicles increased by 5.7% and 0.2% respectively. 
Although the level of credit operations with corporations has been stable, internally funded operations grew by 2.8% or R$2.2 billion, the same amount by which externally funded operations decreased. This reduction was due to the payment of obligations and the foreign exchange appreciation observed in December. 
Investment indicators improved slightly in recent months, though not enough to reverse the accumulated negative results for the year, which were associated with the uncertain macroeconomic environment. Capital goods output grew by 2.7% in November, reducing the accumulated decrease in the year to 1.3%. On the other hand, after con-secutive increases between August and October, the production of inputs for civil construction decreased by 0.1% in November, leading to accumulated growth of 3.4% in the year. 
In November, industrial production expanded for the sixth consecutive month, increasing by 0.5% as compared to the previous month, according to seasonally adjusted data from IBGE. In the year to November, industrial produc-tion grew by 2.1% as compared to the same period of 2001. By categories of use, the monthly increases were 0.6% in the production of durable consumption goods, and 0.3% in intermediate goods, in addition to the already-mentioned expansion of 2.7% in capital goods. The November result was negatively affected by the 7.6% decrease in oil and natural gas output, basically because an oil platform was taken off-line. 
In the labor market, the average unemployment rate measured by IBGE dropped from 7.4% in October to 7.1% in November. This result was essentially due to a 1% fall in the labor force, since the number of employed workers declined by 0.7% in the month. According to the Ministry of Labor, legally registered employment grew by 0.2% in November, on a seasonally adjusted basis, and by 3.2% over the past 12 months. 
With respect to the external accounts, after the US$1.8 billion surplus in December, the trade balance accumulated a US$13.1 billion surplus in 2002. Exports grew 3.7%, totaling US$60.4 billion, while imports fell 15%. In the first three weeks of January (12 working days), the trade surplus continued on its upward trend, with exports growing and imports falling as compared to the same period of 2002. For the period, the trade surplus reached US$508 million. 
In brief, the level of activity continued to be positively influenced by the adjustment in the external sector while do-mestic demand was stable at a higher level, supported by the disbursements from the FGTS. Prospects for sustain-ing the current level of consumption are supported by the continuity of the disbursements of the FGTS, which will increase in 2003, the reduction in default rates, the payment of debts in the second half of 2002, and the improve-ment in consumers’ expectations. 
The external scenario remained critical in recent weeks, reflecting the growing tension between the US and Iraq. The increase in oil prices, also influenced by the political crisis in Venezuela, may hinder the effort to control infla-tion and create new obstacles to expansionist fiscal and monetary policies aimed at boosting the global economy. Stock markets have been reflecting this tension. With weak corporate results, markets have failed to rebound. In the currency market, the US dollar has depreciated notably against the Euro and Yen recently. 
In the US, there are doubts about the real impact of the new fiscal measures on the economy, which has performed modestly in the last quarter. Unemployment remained in a high level, 6%, and new job creation was very low. In-dustrial production decreased by 0.2% in December, as a result of weak demand for industrial products, and the level of installed capacity utilization remained at 75.4%. Retail sales increased by 1.3% in December, as compared to November, but decreased by 0.1% when automobiles are not considered. Industrial and retail inventories ex-panded by 0.2% in November, in the seasonally adjusted figures. Consumer and producer prices were stable in December, showing that inflation is unlikely to be a risk to the economy. Confidence indicators generally point to an improvement of business sentiment in the manufacturing sector. 
In the Euro area, economic stagnation continues. Low GDP growth is expected in 2003, mainly due to the eco-nomic scenario in Germany, the biggest economy in the region. With inflation subdued, the 0.5 pp reduction in the main refinancing rate in December revealed that the ECB is concerned with this scenario. However, the high inter-est differential between the US dollar and the Euro, in addition to the fragility of the US economy, led to a significant appreciation of the Euro in the recent weeks. The currency movement may sharpen the worsening of the Euro area’s trade balance that has been seen recently. Confidence indicators reflect the pessimism of both businesses and consumers. 
In Japan, the most recent data have not helped to reduce the pessimism regarding economic recovery. In Novem-ber, an unexpected improvement in exports compensated for the weak performance in other sectors. Relative to October, equipment orders decreased by 7.4% and industrial production fell by 2.2%. The consumer price index decreased for the 38th consecutive month. 
In Argentina, the provisional agreement with the IMF, which will last until the end of August 2003, provides refinanc-ing for overdue and upcoming debt maturities to the IMF, the IDB and the World Bank but does not provide new disbursements of funds to the country.
In December, inflation rates fell somewhat, although the increases in both wholesale and consumer prices were still high. The IPCA increased 2.10% compared to 3.02% in November, accumulating 12.53% for the year. The IGP-DI reached 2.70% in December compared to 5.84% in the previous month, accumulating a 26.41% increase in 2002. 
The lower increase of the IPCA resulted from reduced pressure from monitored prices, which posted a 1.53% in-crease in December compared to 4.29% in November, and contributed 0.43 p.p. to December inflation. With re-spect to free prices, tradable goods produced the strongest pressure, although the increase in tradable prices fell from 3.58% in November to 3.28% in December (contributing 1.31 p.p. to the overall December IPCA). Price in-creases were particularly notable in: beans, cigarettes, chicken, rice, medicines, milk and dairy products, beef and electronics. Non-tradable goods prices increased 1.14% in December (contributing 0.36 p.p. to overall inflation), compared to 1.27% in the previous month, reflecting lower pressure from fresh food prices. 
With respect to the IGP-DI, the wholesale price component of the index posted a sharp deceleration in December, rising by 3.14%, in comparison to 7.45% in November. The increase in the consumer price component also decel-erated, averaging 1.94% compared to 3.14% in November. This was the result of smaller increases in food prices, transportation and housing. The INCC increased 1.7% compared to 2.45% in November, reflecting the lower rise in the prices of construction inputs. 
In the beginning of 2003, inflation is expected to fall further. However, inflation rates will remain at relatively high levels. In January, price indices will still be impacted by the adjustment of monitored prices in December, particu-larly for oil byproducts. Additionally, inflation will also be pushed up through March by the seasonal adjustment of education expenses. 
On the eve of the Copom meeting in December, the spreads between the Over-Selic target and the 1-month and the 1-year interest rates were 253 b.p. and 717 b.p., respectively. The 300 b.p. target increase exceeded market expectations, causing the reduction of the spreads to 9 b.p. and 296 b.p, respectively. Subsequently, the an-nouncement of private external borrowings at the beginning of the year and improved risk perceptions reduced the spread of the 1-year interest rate to 176 b.p. on January 21. 
A total of US$5.7 billion in securities and foreign exchange rate swap contracts matured from December 19 to January 22. The rollover of the three maturities, through swap contracts with terms ranging from one month and two years, totaled US$5.2 billion. A significant reduction in the slope of the exchange rate coupon curve across all maturities allowed lower rates in the auctions when compared to rates attained during the period of the previous meeting. 
The Treasury carried out three LFT auctions, which totaled R$13.1 billion, with an average maturity of 363 days. The increasing demand for LFTs seen since October declined after the last Copom meeting, though there is evi-dence of growing appetite for fixed income securities. 
The BCB intervened in the open market 21 times from December 19 to January 21, in order to withdraw and pro-vide liquidity. The rates were 24.90% and 25.00%, respectively, and the average daily volumes were R$59.1 billion and R$3.2 billion, respectively. The BCB carried out eight longer-tenure repo operations, with average tenure of 15 business days and average amount of R$3.1 billion. 
The financial settlements from December 19 to January 21 caused a contractionary monetary impact of R$1.2 bil-lion, basically due to net placements of R$9.2 billion of LFTs, partially offset by net redemptions of FX-indexed securities (R$5.1 billion), of LTNs (R$1.7 billion) and of NTN-Cs (R$0.9 billion). 
The identified shocks and their impact were reassessed according to newly available information. The scenario considered in the simulations assumes the following hypothesis: 
1. As mentioned in previous Copom minutes, the projections for the prices of oil by-products are still based on the changes in international oil prices and the exchange rate since the last price adjustment. Already taking into consideration the effects of the last adjustments in the January IPCA, an increase of 0.2% in the con-sumer price of gasoline is expected for 2003. For bottled gas, the price is expected to decline by 1.6% in 2003. 
2. The projection for an increase in household electricity tariffs of 30.3% in 2003 was unchanged. 
3. For the set of prices administered by contracts and monitored, which had a weight of 28.0% in the Decem-ber IPCA, increases of 14% and 8% are expected for 2003 and 2004, respectively. In relation to the projec-tions at the last meeting, there was a rise of 1 p.p. for 2003, due mainly to the revision of the estimated ad-justments in the prices of gasoline, urban transport and alcohol. For 2004, the increase of 0.4 p.p. was a consequence of the revision of the expectations for the IGP-M, since the Copom assumes that all the prices administered by contracts and monitored follow the change of the IGP-M for the specified year. 
4. The projection for the 6-month spread over the Selic rate, which utilizes an error correction-based model specification, was 150 b.p. for the first quarter of 2003 and through the end of this year. 
Core inflation calculated with the exclusion of household food items and of administered prices - considering the broadened set of these items which had a weight of 28.0% in the December IPCA - registered a 1.66% increase in December, a significant rise in comparison to the observed changes of 1.17% in November, 0.74% in October and 0.61% in September. The 12-month accumulated change in December was 8.30%. Core inflation calculated under the trimmed-mean method registered a 1.36% increase in December, a small change in relation to November (1.32%) but significantly higher than in October (0.78%). For the year, the trimmed-mean core measure increased 8.84%. Regarding core inflation of the IPC-BR, calculated under the symmetric trimmed-mean method, the inflation rate reached 1.39% in December and 8.76% in 12-months. 
The increase of the IPCA accumulated in 12 months rose to 12.53% in December, after reaching 10.93% in No-vember, 8.44% in October and 7.93% in September. In the last twelve months, free market prices contributed 7.95 p.p. to inflation, while prices administered by contracts and monitored contributed 4.58 p.p. 
Regarding fiscal policy, it is assumed that the primary surplus target for this year and for the next years will be achieved. The other related assumptions established in the previous meeting were maintained. 
From the simulation exercises with several specifications of the structural model, it has been concluded that the maintenance of the interest rate at 25.0% p.a. and of the exchange rate at a level close to the level on the eve of the Copom meeting indicates inflation slightly above the adjusted target of 8.5% for 2003, as specified in the Open Letter of the Governor of the Banco Central do Brasil to the Minister of Finance on January 21, 2003. 
Economic activity has stabilized at a higher level than at the beginning of last year. In November, industrial produc-tion increased for the sixth consecutive month, supported by sectors linked to exports and non-durable goods. 
Economic indicators have been signaling that consumption should also continue to grow moderately in the upcom-ing months. Since August, the retail sector's revenues have remained stable in real terms at a relatively high level, slightly above the figures observed in 2000. Defaults are falling and, in January, future consumption intentions repeated the level of December, the highest since 2000. The disbursements of around R$10 billion from the FGTS during 2003 will also help to support consumption growth this year. 
Besides consumption, the growth of net exports is another factor that has been supporting aggregate demand, although its contribution to growth in 2003 may be lower than in 2002, considering the substantial expansion of the trade surplus last year. 
Last year, the large contraction in capital flows due to the increase in global risk aversion and the confidence crisis related to the Brazilian economy led to a strong adjustment in the current account deficit and, therefore, a more depreciated real exchange rate. In fact, the more depreciated exchange rate produced the external adjustment, with the current account deficit below US$8 billion in the year. On the other hand, there was great pressure on infla-tion in the last months of 2002. Despite the high inflation – considering only the last quarter the increase in IPCA reached 6.5% – inflation in 2002 can be more appropriately characterized as a change in relative prices, consider-ing that the prices of tradable goods increased more than the prices of non-tradables. Accordingly, monetary policy has been conducted in order to limit the effects of the exchange rate depreciation to the change in relative prices, preventing the propagation of this shock and facilitating the convergence of inflation to its targets. 
Since the last Copom meeting in December and, more visibly in the first weeks of January, an improvement in local financial markets has been observed as a consequence of lower risk perception. Mutual funds received net inflows, the FX coupon and fixed interest rates declined, and Brazilian banks and companies recovered access to external funding. Reflecting this better perception of Brazilian risk, the exchange rate appreciated, reaching the minimum 
level of R$3.28 per US dollar on January 14. However, during the days before the Copom meeting, the BRL started to depreciate again, mainly due to the possibility of war between the United States and Iraq. 
The median of 2003 inflation expectations surveyed by the Investor Relations Group has remained relatively stable at a high level. Expectations of the "top 5" institutions for the IPCA fell to 10.23% on January 17 from 13.49% on December 30, 2002. Moreover, the median of the expectations for the next two months indicate a decline of infla-tion to 1.12% in February and 0.65% in March. 
In fact, inflation indices have shown clear signs of deceleration. The increase in the IPCA fell to 2.10% in December from 3.02% in November. The increase in the IGP-DI declined to 2.70% in December from 5.84% in November. The increase in the IGP-10 fell to 2.29% in January from 4.87% in December. The increase in the IPA-10 declined to 2.60% in January from 5.91% in December. Finally, the increase in the IPC/Fipe fell to 1.83% in December and to 1.79% in the four-week period ended in the second week of January from 2.65% in November. 
Moreover, preliminary price data collected in recent weeks indicate that inflation is falling in January, most visibly in the segment of food and beverages, which slowed the most in the week previous to the Copom meeting. Inflation expectations for the year should decrease as soon as this trend is confirmed, in a context where monetary policy demonstrates its strong commitment in driving inflation to the targets. 
There will be no changes in the adjusted target during the year, except in the case of a relevant change in the fore-cast (upward or downward from the 14% already expected) for prices administered by contracts or monitored (ex-cluding the exchange rate change), since these prices are not directly affected by monetary policy. 
Although inflation has declined recently, inflation indices reached high levels at the end of last year, and the con-vergence of inflation to the adjusted targets depends on the speed at which inflation continues to fall. In this con-text, it is important to evaluate the impact on inflation of the accumulated 7 p.p. increase in the Selic rate that oc-curred in the last quarter of 2002. The maintenance of the target for the Selic rate at 25% would result in an infla-tion projection a little above the adjusted target of 8.5% in 2003.
"
26/02/2003;81;Henrique Meirelles;"Recent economic indicators have pointed out some deceleration in activity. In December, both industrial output and retail sales contracted, after having posted monthly increases throughout the second half of 2002. The fall in real income and the worsening in credit market conditions persist as main contractive factors, offsetting the positive effect of the extraordinary disbursements from the FGTS. At the same time, the uncertain global environment does not encourage a recovery in domestic investment. Export growth and import substitution remain as key factors to support economic activity. 
According to seasonally adjusted data from Fecomercio-SP, real retail sales in greater São Paulo fell 4.3% in De-cember as compared to the previous month. In January, preliminary data suggest a new contraction, of 1.68%. Accounting for the January figures, retail sales returned to the first half of 2002 level. 
The Fecomercio-SP survey on consumer confidence showed deteriorating expectations in February, mirroring the growing inflation concerns. The IIC stood at 102.5 in February from 106.7 in January, in a scale ranging from 0 to  200, with reductions of 1.9% and 4.9% for current and future consumption intentions, respectively. These de-creases took place after a substantial recovery in the last quarter of 2002. 
Regarding default rates in the retail trade sector, the share of returned checks substantially increased in January, reaching 5.3%, the historical peak for the series. ACSP data indicated that, though the cancelled default registra-tions remained high in January, the fact that the number of new arrears increased forced the delinquency rate up, when compared to December. 
The default rate in non-earmarked credit operations did not follow the trend in the retail sector, remaining at 8%. Corporate default rates increased 0.1 p.p. in January to 4.3%, roughly stable since July 2002. As far as individuals are concerned, the default rate diminished 0.3 p.p., standing at 14.5%. It is worth stressing the 0.9 p.p. fall in ar-rears in overdraft accounts. 
Investment indicators fell again in December, repeating the trend observed throughout the semester due to the uncertainties of the period. Considering December data, the investment rate closed the year at 17.7% of GDP compared to 19.2% in 2001. All components of fixed investment fell in 2002. 
Regarding capital goods, the 27% drop in output of energy generation machinery should be mentioned, due to the conclusion of the investment cycle triggered by the energy rationing. On the other hand, agricultural machines out-put grew 18.6% due to the increase in this sector real income. 
Industrial output fell 1.8% s.a. in December as compared to November, breaking off the growing trend noticed since June. The fall in manufacturing affected 18 out of 20 industrial activities and followed the reduction in industrial sales surveyed by the CNI in November and December (-7.1% and –1.1% s.a., respectively). The 7% reduction in mineral extraction output was due to prescheduled maintenance interruptions in oil and gas fields. Considering the December figure, industrial production grew 2.4% in 2002, boosted by the 10.7% expansion in mineral extraction output, mainly oil and gas. The 1.4% growth rate in manufacturing output was led by the agribusiness and exports’ sectors. 
Concerning business sentiment, the CNI survey tracked some recovery in confidence at the end of 2002 and in the beginning of 2003. The FGV survey of the manufacturing sector, conducted with 1,100 companies all over Brazil, indicated that the business community expects a recovery in demand in a 6-month horizon, though anticipating a short-term contraction. The low level of industrial inventories is one factor that boosts business confidence. Also worth mentioning, the level of capacity utilization in January (80.8%) does not restrict activity except in very specific industries. 
Employed workers grew 0.2% in December, s.a., and 3.6% for the year when compared to 2001, according to data from the Ministry of Labor and Employment. The jobless rate measured by the new monthly survey by IBGE, in-cluding the six largest metropolitan areas of Brazil, fell to 10.5% in December from 10.9% in November. 
The trade balance posted a US$1.2 billion surplus in January, with a 21% growth in exports (US$4.8 billion) and a 4.1% fall in imports, both compared to the same month of 2002. Up to the second week of February (including 10 working days), the trade surplus reached US$789 million, averaging US$253 million/day for exports and US$175 million/day for imports. 
Adding up briefly, activity level lost momentum at the end of 2002, after a positive performance throughout the sec-ond half of the year. Despite the continuity of the external adjustment, as well as positive signs in business senti-ment, domestic expenditure contracted due to the fall in real income, the worsening in credit market conditions and the falling investment caused by the uncertain environment, mainly on the external front. 
The external scenario remained stressful in the last few weeks, reflecting growing tension about a possible war in the Middle East. Besides the direct concerns about the war, in relation to length and its economic, social and politi-cal outcomes, global financial markets anticipated the risks that any decision is not unanimously taken by the UN Security Council. 
This framework helped to pull up oil prices, deteriorating the uncertainties regarding the global economy prospects, even in a short-lasting war scenario. This environment complicates the outlook for emerging market economies, mainly the ones dependent of external funding. 
Doubts about the US recovery persist, as the uncertainties about war in Iraq do not encourage investment expendi-ture. GDP growth decelerated in the last quarter of 2002, to 0.7%, supported by government consumption expendi-tures (up 4.6%). Personal consumption (about 2/3 of GDP) increased by only 1%, the lowest rate in nearly ten years. 
In the euro area economic stagnation continues, led by the German economy. The European Central Bank main-tained the main refinancing rate at 2.75% in its last meeting 
In Japan, the most recent economic data showed that the economy has stabilized, but doubts persist about a sus-tained recovery. In December, though exports fell, industrial orders increased when compared to November. GDP grew 2% in annual terms in the last quarter of 2002, according to a preliminary estimate. 
In Argentina, economic activity resumed the upward trend, supported by the import substitution process. The sharp fall in imports helped to achieve a record US$16.4 billion trade surplus in 2002. 
In January, the trend of the main price indices was not uniform. Consumer inflation grew, after having decelerated somewhat in December, whilst wholesale inflation fell again, particularly for agricultural prices. The IPCA increased 2.25% compared to 2.10% in December. The IGP-DI reached 2.17% in the month (2.70% in December), reflecting changes of 2.21% in the IPA, 2.32% in the IPC and 1.51% in the INCC. For the first time since April 2002, the IPCA monthly growth was higher than the IPA’s. 
The growth of consumer price indices was mainly due to the increases of fuel prices and urban transport fares. Food prices decelerated, following the trend observed since the end of November for wholesale agricultural prices. 
In the IPCA, prices of non-food goods increased 2.28% and contributed 1.74 p.p. to the monthly variation. Gasoline, with a 8.82% increase, and readjustment of urban transport tariffs in 5 out of the 11 surveyed capitals by IBGE (Porto Alegre, Fortaleza, Salvador, Belo Horizonte, and São Paulo), with an average increase of 4.99%, were the items that mostly contributed to the monthly result, 0.39 p.p. and 0.23 p.p., respectively. Food prices, even hav-ing increased significantly, grew less in January (2.15%) as compared to December (3.91%). 
With respect to the IGP, the 2.21% increase in the IPA resulted from increases of 1.16% in agricultural prices and 2.64% in industrial prices, both decelerating as compared to the previous two months. Regarding agricultural price-s, the deceleration was even sharper due to the beginning of the new harvest, besides decreases in the prices of some agricultural commodities, resulting from lower international prices and an appreciated exchange rate (monthly averages). In the industrial prices, the deceleration was less intense, although some groups as chemicals (fuel and lubricants) and textiles still posted some pressure. 
In February, inflation shall cool down somewhat. In the IPCA, regulated and monitored prices are expected to be under pressure due to the residual effect of the readjustments of fuel prices and urban transport fares, let alone the mobile phone tariffs that were readjusted in February. Among the free market prices, the highest variations may 
come from the segment of education. The readjustment of monthly school fees, for methodological reasons, influ-ences the IPCA variation with more intensity in February, differently from other indices, whose higher effect oc-curred in January. 
Uncertainties in the external scenario and the release of inflation figures above market consensus brought about expectations of a higher over-Selic target on the Copom February meeting. On February 18th, eve of the Copom decision, the spreads of 1-month and 6-month interest rates were 120 and 284 b.p., respectively. 
A total of US$4.2 billion in securities and FX swaps maturing in February was rolled over through swap contracts. On the February 3 rollover, the equivalent to US$1.7 billion was placed as contracts with tenures ranging from 1 month to 5 years. The auctions were carried out at rates higher than in the January 22 rollover, due to the increase in the slope of the exchange rate coupon curve. The February 13 rollover (US$2.5 billion of swaps were contracted with tenures ranging from 1 to 29 months) benefited by the decrease of the short-term coupon, due to new private external funding and the rollover of the Banco Central’s FX credit lines. 
The Treasury carried out four LFT auctions, with higher volumes at each event. Financial volume reached R$20.8 billion, with an average maturity of 348 days. Aiming at reducing the concentration of maturities, the Treasury held a purchase auction of LFT, draining the equivalent to R$1.6 billion from the market, in securities maturing in April. In the period, approximately R$0.7 billion was placed in NTN-C, with tenures of 5, 14 and 18 years. 
From January 24 on, the Banco Central has altered its strategy of intervening in the open market, aiming at length-ening the tenure of its repo operations. Usual interventions had their tenures lengthening from 1 to up to 5 working days. Also, five 1-month repo operations were carried out, draining R$37.2 billion from the market. 
Securities settlements from January 23 to February 18 caused a contractive monetary impact of R$6.5 billion, basi-cally due to net placements of R$10.6 billion of LFT, partially offset by net redemptions of FX-indexed securities (R$4.4 billion). 
In January, domestic securitized public debt increased by R$13.7 billion (+2,2%), due to net placements of R$2.6 billion in securities and interest accrual. 
The identified shocks and their inflationary impact were reassessed according to newly available information. The scenario considered in the simulations assumes the following hypotheses: 
1. The projection for the increase in gasoline prices was revised to 8.0% for 2003, including the rises in the beginning of the year. An increase of 8.0 p.p. is forecasted for the prices of bottled gas, as compared to the January Copom meeting, 
2. Regarding the previous meeting, the forecasted rise in household electricity tariffs for 2003 decreased to 27.1% from 30.3%, due to the revision of the readjustments proposed by the Aneel for this year, 
3. For the set of regulated and monitored prices, which had a weight of 27.9% in the January IPCA, an in-crease of 15.9% is projected for 2003, from which 3.8% has already occurred in January. The decrease in the projections for household electricity tariffs was offset by higher prices of gasoline, bottled gas, urban transport, and interstate transport. For 2004, the forecast increase for the set of regulated and monitored prices is 8.7%. The increase of 0.7 p.p. compared to the January estimate was due to the revision of ex-pectations for the IGP-M, since the Copom assumes that all the regulated and monitored prices follow the change of the IGP-M for the specified year,
4. The projection for the 6-month spread over the Selic rate, which utilizes an error correction-based model specification, was 200 b.p. for the first quarter of 2003 though gradually reaching –150 b.p. at the end of 2004. 
Core inflation calculated with the exclusion of household food items and of regulated and monitored prices posted a 1.38% increase in January, a significant decrease in comparison to the 1.66% observed in December, but still higher than the observed in the previous months. In January, the 12-month accumulated change was 9.69%. Core inflation calculated under the trimmed-mean method registered a 1.32% increase in January, back to the value registered in November 2002 and slightly below the December figure (1.36%). In the last 12 months, the core in-creased by 9.70%. Regarding core inflation of IPC-BR, calculated under the symmetric trimmed-mean method, the inflation rate reached 1.39% in December and 8.76% in 12 months. 
The accumulated variation for the IPCA in 12 months increased to 14.47% in January 2003, as compared to 12.53% in December 2002. In the last 12 months, free market prices contributed 8.74 p.p. to inflation, while prices regulated and monitored contributed 5.73 p.p. 
Regarding fiscal policy, it is assumed that the primary surplus target for this year will be achieved (4.25%). The other related assumptions established in the previous meeting were maintained. 
From the simulation exercises with several specifications of the structural model, it has been concluded that the maintenance of the interest rate at 25.5% p.a. and of the exchange rate at the prevailing on the eve of the Copom meeting indicates inflation higher than the adjusted target of 8.5% for 2003. 
In the last year, the confidence crisis regarding the future of the Brazilian economy and the increase in global risk aversion resulted in a U$30 billion decrease in capital inflows to Brazil and a current account deficit adjustment of nearly 3% of the GDP. This external adjustment triggered a sharp exchange rate depreciation (44%), since GDP has grown around 1.6%. The significant exchange rate depreciation represented an important shift in relative prices, what resulted in an inflation rate of 6.6% in the last quarter of 2002. This higher inflation was the major cost inherited from the last year crisis. 
The Brazilian economy has been reacting to the last year shock through measures that have recovered the confi-dence and allowed capital flows to return. The FX inflow was positive in January (US$1.1 billion) for the first time since March 2002, a trend sustained in February. Regarding the primary placement of public securities, the Treas-ury has been issuing larger volumes of LFT with no pressures on yields or tenures. On its turn, inflation to the con-sumer has been decelerating. IPCA moved from the 3.02% peak in November to 2.25% in January. Similarly, free market prices inflation has been decreasing since the 2.53% peak in November to 2.32% in December and 1.64% in January. 
There are reasons to believe that inflation may continue to decrease. On one hand, economic activity seems to be decelerating. In the retail sector, the sharpened decrease in real sales in December reflects the fall of real income and worsened credit conditions for the consumers. Industrial production, in the same month, interrupted the grow-ing trajectory drawn in the previous six months and, based on leading indicators, may continue to move backwards in January. In this sense, it is important to consider the future impact on inflation of the accumulated increase of 750 b.p. in the over-Selic rate since last October. On the other hand, the maintenance of the pace of capital inflows observed in the beginning of this year may imply a higher supply in the FX market and, on a less adverse external scenario, allow some favorable pressure on the exchange rate. 
Notwithstanding, there is the risk of inflation to continue in a high level, as the current inflation level shows some rigidity. Due to the inertial mechanism of price formation in the Brazilian economy, the high inflation of the last year has been reflecting in a higher inflation in the beginning of this year. IPCA core inflation in January moved back-
ward as compared to the previous month, but the variation was higher than the observed in the three first quarters of 2002. Estimates for consumer price indices in February continue to show high rates of inflation, higher than in January. In the second 4-week estimate of February, IPC-Fipe increased by 2.13%, slightly below the first week (2.23%), but well above the second preview of January (1.79%). 
Preliminary data of prices collected in the last weeks indicate that free market prices inflation has been decreasing in February, even though there is a strong pressure of items such as in natura food and school fees. However, the results of these price collections suggest a high variation in the IPCA compared to the adjusted inflation target tra-jectory. 
As in the last years’ trend, regulated and monitored prices continue to put a strong pressure on the consumer infla-tion. In January, IPCA inflation moved upward due to the significant increase in regulated and monitored prices (3.83%), 2.3 times higher than the free prices average increase. Even weighting 27.9%, regulated and monitored prices were responsible for 47% of the January IPCA rate and 40% of the IPCA accumulated in the last 12 months. 
As an example, while free market prices inflation reached 1.64% in January, the price of gasoline for the consumer rose by 8.82%, the major individual contribution to IPCA in the month. This increase was due to the passthrough of the 12.8% rise in the refineries on last December 29, besides the increase caused by changes in the basis for cal-culating the ICMS. Alcohol-based fuel prices increased by 5.96% in January, as compared to 2.96% in the previous month, mainly because of rises endorsed by producers. Prices of diesel oil increased by 11.88% in January, added to the 8.01% increase in December. Price increase in January reflected mainly the 11.3% readjustment in the refin-eries on December 29. 
The readjustment of 4.99% in urban transport fares has also put a strong pressure on regulated prices in January, even after the strong increase in December (2.67%). Local governments of Belo Horizonte (10.43%), São Paulo (10.00%), Salvador (8.18%), Porto Alegre (4.17%), and Fortaleza (1.67%) practiced the most significant increases. Interstate bus fares were also readjusted by 7.18%, with pressure coming from the increases in Belo Horizonte (17.18%), São Paulo (12.63%), Belém (6.36%), Porto Alegre (5.93%) and Salvador (5.33%). 
Moreover, the 2.73% increase in the household electricity tariff was due to the readjustments in Rio de Janeiro (10.97%) and Brasília (8.43%). In Rio, one of the concessionaries carried out a 28.56% contractual readjustment. 
It should be highlighted that the effects of the readjustments in regulated and monitored prices may not only con-tribute directly to inflation but also risk propagating secondarily to free market prices. 
It is important to say that over the three first quarters of 2003 the 12-month accumulated inflation shall remain high, carrying the statistical effects of the inflation of the last quarter of 2002. Under this scenario, it is important the per-ception that inflation over 2003 keeps falling. 
Copom understands that in this moment, when inertia in Brazilian economy transfers the impact of the last year’s shock to a higher inflation this year, monetary policy should be firm enough to eliminate the risk of a shift in the inflation level. So, Copom evaluates an additional effort in monetary policy as appropriate. 
Besides, Copom understands that not only the economic policy actions of the Government but also the reactions of the society against inflation are important to a less costly reduction of inflation. In this sense, recent measures adopted by the Government aiming at reaffirming fiscal responsibility and fiscal consistence together with structural reforms are beneficial not only in the direct related areas but also boost the monetary policy efficiency. As the Bra-zilian experience clearly shows, the effort that society make to keep prices stable is fundamental to protect itself against the inflation tax and its regressive impacts and to the development strategy. The stability ensures the ca-pacity of planning and investing through a more accurate predictability and lengthening of horizons.
"
27/03/2003;82;Henrique Meirelles;"Recently released economic indicators showed some loss of dynamism in industrial activity and the retail sector.
Export growth and import substitution continue to support aggregate demand, partially offsetting the contractionary effect of the decrease in real incomes and the worsening in credit conditions.
According to the IBGE, in January, the national retail sales index fell 4.9% compared to January of last year. With respect to the 12-month accumulated index, the decline seen in recent months worsened slightly (1% in January compared to 0.7% at the end of 2002). By sector, supermarkets, food products, beverage and tobacco was the segment responsible for most of the decrease in sales for the second consecutive month, reflecting the decline in workers’ real incomes due to higher prices of food and cleaning and personal hygiene products
The Fecomércio-SP survey showed a decline in consumer confidence in March, with the IIC falling to 97.8 from 102.5 in February, reflecting a decrease of 7.7% in current consumer intentions and 3% in future intentions. These declines suggest the reversal of the optimistic sentiment seen immediately after the presidential elections, due to concerns over unemployment, inflation and the international scenario.
Regarding defaults on retail credit, ACSP statistics reveal that the number of new delinquency registrations fell by 2.2% in February as compared to January, but the amount of canceled registrations decreased 7.1%, also compared to January. Thus, the net default rate increased to 6.8% in February from 6.2% in the previous month.
The delinquency rate on non-earmarked bank credits increased 0.2 p.p. in February, to 8.4%. The default rate for individuals and corporate loans reached 15.1% and 4.5%, respectively. The average interest rate on bank credits increased 2.6 p.p. in February to 56.5% p.a.
Total non-earmarked bank credits increased 0.8% in February, reflecting mainly the seasonal growth of operations with individuals, which increased 1.2%. Credits to companies increased 0.5%, with the expansion largely funded domestically. Of note in this area is the growth of ACC operations, which have been favored by the normalization of external bank-to-bank trade lines.
Investment indicators improved slightly in January, after the downward trend observed in the second half of 2002 due to the uncertainties that marked the period. The domestic output of machines and equipment, the volume of capital goods imports and the production of inputs for civil construction increased 5.1%, 16.7% and 0.6%, respectively, compared to December (s.a.).
Industrial output in Brazil increased 0.7% in January compared to the previous month, s.a., according to the IBGE.
The rise was the result of a 13.7% increase in mineral extraction, as manufacturing output fell 0.2%. This behaviour in the mineral extraction sector was a consequence of the normalization of activities in Brazil’s oil and gas fields, after prescheduled maintenance interruptions in the last two months of 2002.
Regarding the evolution of the manufacturing sector, the January result confirms the signs of a slowdown in industrial activity, with the exception of the sectors closely linked to external trade. In fact, industrial sales fell 0.1% in January according to the CNI, the third consecutive monthly fall.
Data for the automobile sector up to February also confirm that exports are contributing strongly to the improvement in the trade balance. Seasonally adjusted data shows that wholesale domestic auto sales declined 2.4% in February and 6.9% in the quarter ended last month, while auto exports increased 0.3% and 23.6%, respectively, in the same periods.
In the labor market, legally registered employment increased 0.2% month-on-month in January, s.a., and 3.5% compared to January 2002, according to the Ministry of Labor. According to the new methodology for the Monthly
Employment Survey, the unemployment rate measured by IBGE in the six main metropolitan regions reached 11.2% in January, compared to 10.5% in December. This rise repeated the normal seasonal pattern for January,
when there are more unemployed workers seeking for jobs.
With respect to the external accounts, the trade balance posted a US$1.1 billion surplus in February, accumulating a US$2.3 billion surplus in the first two months of 2003. Considering daily averages, exports increased 23% in February and 22.4% in the first two months of the year, compared to the values registered in the same periods of 2002. Imports increased 2.7% in February and decreased 0.5% in the first two months of the year. In the first two weeks of March (8 working days), the trade surplus totaled US$491 million. The expansion of exports resulted mainly from the continuous growth of sales to the US and China, and the recovery of trade with Argentina, in addition to the increase in prices of important export commodities.
Summing up, economic activity lost momentum at the end of 2002 and in the beginning of this year, even though exports have continued to grow. There are signs that domestic demand has weakened due to the drop in real income as a consequence of higher inflation, a trend only partly attenuated by extraordinary disbursements from the FGTS. Additionally, consumer expectations have shown a reversal of the optimism seen during the governmental transition.
The uncertainty regarding the possibility of a military confrontation in Iraq was the major development in the international economic scenario. This environment contributed to volatility in the financial markets. In recent days, with the war coming closer after the US ultimatum, stock prices rose, oil prices declined and the US dollar appreciated, reversing previous trends. Notwithstanding these short-term developments, recent indicators have shown that the main economies are facing difficulties in consolidating their fundamentals, mainly with worsened fiscal accounts and less room to maneuver monetary policy.
In the US, GDP growth decelerated strongly in the last quarter of 2002, falling to 1.4% p.a., according to preliminary data. The US current account deficit increased in the fourth quarter, reaching 5% of GDP in 2002. In February, retail sales fell 1.7% and the unemployment rate rose to 5.8%, with the elimination of 308 thousand jobs. Consumer confidence indicators worsened significantly while those related to business expectations are barely above the indifference level. Inflation measured by the PPI increased 1%, accumulating a 3.5% increase in the 12 months ending in February, under the pressure of the recent increase in fuel prices.
The Euro area continues to grow slowly, led by the weak performance of the German economy. The fiscal deficit in Germany surpassed the limit set by the European Union, which may lead to fiscal tightening. The ECB reduced the basic interest rate by 0.25 p.p. in March, setting it at 2.5% p.a., the lowest level of the last three years. European consumer confidence has been hurt by expectations of war in Iraq and increasing unemployment.
In February, inflation decelerated to its lowest rates since last October. The IPCA increased 1.57% compared to 2.25% in January, accumulating an increase of 3.86% in the first two months of the year and 15.85% in 12 months. The IGP-DI increased 1.59% in February, compared to 2.17% in the previous month, accumulating an increase of 3.8% in the first two months of the year and 30.73% in 12 months. In the IPCA, inflation in both free market prices and regulated and monitored prices decelerated, posting increases of 1.10% and 2.71%, respectively, compared to 1.64% and 3.83% in the previous month. Among free market prices, the main increases occurred in school fees and perishable food due to seasonal reasons, with both categories rising by 6.5%. Important food products in the consumer basket—soybean oil, rice, meat and chicken— registered price declines of 0.75%, 0.73%, 0.57% and 0.49%, respectively. Among regulated prices, the largest contributions came from the 5.9% increase in urban transport, 3.3% increase in gasoline, 11.8% increase in alcohol-based fuel, and 3.5% increase in telephone fares. It should be highlighted that the price of bottled cookingas declined by 3.7%.
With respect to the IGP, the IPA sub-index increased 1.71% in February as compared to 2.21% in January, with the deceleration due to the behavior of industrial prices, as agricultural price inflation increased slightly, from 1.16% to 1.20%. This increase reflected the unfavorable contribution of grains and exporting commodities, and higher increases in the prices of legumes and fruits. Industrial prices decelerated broadly, increasing 1.91%, as compared to 2.64% in January. Of the most heavily weighted segments, only the prices of chemical products decelerated less sharply, due to increases in the prices of fuel and lubricants, fertilizers and plastic.  In March, inflation measured by the main price indices will continue to fall although it will remain at high levels compared to the average for this month in previous years. Considering the IPCA, regulated and monitored prices will decelerate strongly, due to the end of the impacts of the recent readjustments. Regarding free market prices, increases in the prices of medicines will be the main source of pressure, while clothing will contribute favorably for seasonal reasons. With respect to wholesale prices, agricultural products will contribute to the reduction of the indices, mainly as the result of lower price increases for grains and some vegetables.
In the period after the Copom decision in February, the reduction of country risk, the appreciation of the exchange rate and the deceleration of inflation contributed to consecutive and significant reductions in the slope of the yield curve. On March 18, the eve of this month’s Copom meeting, the spreads of the 1-month and 1-year interest rates were 5 b.p. and 57 b.p., respectively.
Securities and FX swaps maturing since the previous meeting were fully rolled over through swaps. The US$1.3 billion maturing on March 5 was rolled over with terms ranging from 3 to 67 months (12.4 months on average). The favorable bid/ask ratio allowed the rollover in a single auction. Of the US$1.9 billion rolled over on March 13, two auctions occurred, with the tenor of the swaps ranging from 2 to 49 months (8.2 months on average). The rollover of securities and FX swaps maturing on April 1 was held in advance, and through an auction on March 14 a total of US$0.8 billion was placed, about 25% of the total to mature. The improvement in country risk and capital inflows contributed to the progressive reduction of the interest rates in these auctions.
The Treasury has resumed the offer of LTNs, which had not occurred since last November. In the period between the February and March meetings, R$2.4 billion were placed, with decreasing rates following the reduction of the yield curve. LFTs were offered four times during this period, with placements totaling R$21.8 billion. The average tenor rose as a result of higher demand for longer-term LFTs, due to the significant reduction in the price discount of shorter tenor securities. A total of R$0.6 billion of NTN-Cs was placed, with tenors of 5, 14 and 18 years. Aiming at reducing the concentration of LFT maturities in upcoming months, the Treasury carried out an auction substituting longer tenor bonds for R$2.1 billion in securities with maturities in the next 1 to 2 months. The settlement of securities between February 20 to March 19 caused a contractionary monetary impact of R$2.7 billion, due to net placements of R$4.8 billion of LFTs and R$2.4 billion of LTNs, partially offset by net redemptions of FX-indexed securities (R$4.5 billion).
In the same period, the Central Bank intervened in the money market through repo operations ranging from 7 to 30 days, and through daily liquidity management operations with maturities of 2-working days, with the aim of reducing the need for daily interventions and withdrawing excess liquidity through longer-term operations.
The identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available information. The scenario considered in the simulations assumes the following hypotheses:
1. The projection for the increase in gasoline prices rose to 12.4% from 8.0% for 2003 since the February Copom meeting. Considering the adjustments up to February, this hypothesis assumes the price of gasoline remains stable until the end of the year. An increase of 4.2% is forecast for the price of bottled cooking gas in 2003, of which 0.7% occurred in the year to February. This forecast is 2.2 p.p. below the previous meeting.
2. As compared to the previous meeting, the forecast rise in household electricity tariffs for 2003 is roughly stable, standing at 27.5% compared to 27.1% in February.
3. For the set of regulated and monitored prices, which had a weight of 28.3% in the February IPCA, an increase of 16.8% is projected for 2003, of which 6.6% has already occurred in the first two months of the year. The increase of 0.9 p.p. compared to the forecast at the February meeting already took place. The forecast for the increase in the regulated prices from March to the end of the year remained practically stable at 9.5%. For 2004, the forecast for the increase in these prices is 9%, practically unaltered since the previous meeting (8.7%).
4. The projection for the 6-month spread over the Selic rate, following a new specification of the VAR model using the variables Selic rate and swap rate in levels, was 70 b.p. in the days before the meeting, rising gradually to 100 b.p. in the beginning of 2004. Core inflation calculated with the exclusion of household food items and of regulated and monitored prices fell to 1.0% in February, confirming the deceleration trend observed since December, but still higher than the first three quarters of 2002. The 12-month accumulated change was 9.4%. Core inflation calculated under the trimmed-mean method registered a 0.9% increase in February, also decelerating since December (1.4%), but also higher than the first three quarters of 2002. In the last 12 months, the trimmed-mean core increased by 10.1%, as compared to 9.7% in January. Regarding core inflation of the IPC-BR, calculated under the symmetric trimmed-mean method, the rate reached 0.9% in February and 9.9% in 12 months.
The accumulated variation for the IPCA in 12 months increased to 15.8% in February, as compared to 14.5% in
January, due to the exclusion of the February 2002 inflation (0.4%) and the inclusion of the February 2003 inflation (1.6%). In the last 12 months, free market prices contributed 9.4 p.p. to inflation, while regulated and monitored prices contributed 6.4 p.p.
Regarding fiscal policy, it is assumed that the primary surplus target for this year (4.25% of the GDP) will be accomplished. The other related assumptions established in the February Copom meeting were maintained. From the simulation exercises with several specifications of the structural model, it has been concluded that the maintenance of the interest rate in 26.5% p.a. and of the exchange rate at the level prevailing on the eve of the Copom meeting indicates inflation above the adjusted target of 8.5% for 2003.
Economic activity continues to decelerate, as already diagnosed in the minutes of the February Copom meeting. Manufacturing production fell 0.2% in January. However, mineral extraction grew by 13.7%, due to the normalization of activities in the oil sector, offsetting the decline in manufacturing and resulting in a 0.7% growth for overall industrial production. Results for the current account, which were roughly balanced in the first two months of the year, point to the consolidation of the external sector adjustment. There are signals of improvement in the capital account, and new issues abroad have been announced, most of which are shorter than 1 year. Rollover rates continue to recover, although they are at a reduced level, which contributed to negative FX flows in the first days of March. The financial markets improved significantly between the February and March meetings. Sovereign risk fell to 1,067 b.p. from 1,333 b.p. The real appreciated by 5% and the 21-day dollar volatility fell sharply to 12.2% from 20.5% in the same period. Demand for public securities remained high. The Treasury resumed placements of LTNs. Discounts on short term LFTs fell. There are signs that inflation is falling. Monthly IPCA inflation decreased from the 3.02% peak in November to 2.25% in January and 1.57% in February. The fall of inflation in free market prices is even clearer. Free market price inflation registered a peak of 2.53% in November, then declined to 2.32% in December and 1.12% in February, the lowest rate since September 2002. The trimmed-mean core, which had been stable at 1.30% since November, fell to 0.93% in February.
In February, regulated and monitored price inflation (2.7%) was 2.4 times higher than free market price inflation.
Although they had a weight of 28.3% in the IPCA, these prices were responsible for 48% of the inflation in January and February, and for 41% of the inflation accumulated in the last 12 months. The four items that contributed the most in the set of regulated and monitored prices were alcohol-based fuel (11.8%), urban transport (5.9%), telephone (3.5%) and gasoline (3.3%), due to changes in the administration of the ICMS tax.
After the price adjustments in January and February, the forecast for regulated and monitored price inflation in 2003 increased 0.9 p.p., reaching 16.8%. According to this new forecast, the primary effect of the shock of regulated and monitored prices on overall inflation was revised, implying a 1 p.p. rise in the adjusted inflation target for 2003, according to the methodology described in the Open Letter of the Governor of the Banco Central do Brasil to the Ministry of Finance of January 21, 2003. However, the Copom considers it premature to modify the adjusted target at this time due to the high volatility of international oil prices, and believes it is preferable to wait for more information about the adjustments that could affect regulated prices. The downward trend for inflation was maintained in some inflation measures that consider the first weeks of March,
such as the first estimate for the IGP-M and the four-week Fipe indices. Additionally, price surveys in the first two weeks of March confirm the expectations of a decrease in inflation, especially in the food and beverage, education and transport categories, which produced the largest pressures in February. Notwithstanding these developments, there are some significant ongoing price increases, such as in the prices of perishable food in greater São Paulo, alcohol-based auto fuel, and medicines. Based on price surveys and market expectations, inflation measured by the IPCA in March is expected to be below 1%, the lowest in the last 6 months.
The median of market expectations for the IPCA interrupted the upward trajectory that had been observed for seven consecutive weeks and moved back to 12.33% on the eve of the Copom meeting. This expectation incorporates the results of the two first months of the year, both high and strongly affected by the increases in regulated prices. The median of market expectations for the IPCA accumulated in the next 12 months fell to 9.7% from 10.7% between the February and March meetings. The focus on the forward inflation rate is important, since it highlights the perception of a downward trend. Monetary policy is concerned about the future trajectory of inflation. 
Even though the forecast inflation for 2003 in the baseline scenario is above the adjusted target of 8.5%, the outlook for inflation from the second quarter onward, as assessed by the Copom, is positive. First, the Copom considers that monetary policy has been able to bring inflation to a trajectory compatible with the one outlined in the Open Letter to the Ministry of Finance from the second quarter of this year on. Second, it is premature to evaluate the full effect of the monetary policy actions implemented in recent months. Alternative scenarios with inflation trajectories close to the adjusted target for 2003 were also evaluated by the Copom.
"
30/04/2003;83;Henrique Meirelles;"1. Consumer price inflation slowed in March, although by less than expected by the estimates of both the Central Bank and market participants. Monthly inflation remains relatively high. Despite the deceleration in the prices of agricultural products, wholesale inflation increased due to the behavior of industrial goods prices.
2. The IPCA increased 1.23% in March, as compared to 1.57% in the previous month, accumulating 5.13% in the first quarter of 2003, and 16.57% in 12 months. The deceleration in the monthly rate of IPCA inflation was due to fewer readjustments in urban transportation fares, to the dissipation of the impact of the seasonal readjustments of school fees, to the slight fall of gasoline prices, and to lower inflation in the price of alcohol-based motor fuel, items that have put pressure on the index in February.
3. Regulated prices increased 1.07% in March, as compared to 2.71% in February. Free market prices increased 1.29% in March as compared to 1.11% in the previous month, mainly due to the acceleration of price increases for food, particularly perishable food, medicines, cleaning and personal hygiene products, and clothing.
4. The IGP-DI increased 1.66% in March, as compared to 1.59% in February, accumulating 5.52% in the quarter, and 32.75% in 12 months. The upward pressure on the IGP-DI resulted from the behavior of wholesale prices, which increased 1.93% as compared to 1.71% in February. The IPC-Br increased 1.06%, as compared to 1.37% in the previous month, while the INCC remained stable.
5. The agricultural component of the IPA increased 0.32%, pressured by prices of legumes and fruit, as a result of adverse weather conditions. Other important items such as cereals and grains, vegetable oils, , and export crops registered nominal price decreases, due to the exchange rate appreciation and the behavior of international prices. The industrial component of the IPA increased 2.56% as compared to 1.91% in February, reflecting increases in the prices of chemicals (fuel and plastic raw materials), metal products (iron, steel and by-products), pharmaceutical products (medicines and hygiene), and plastic (resins).
6. Core IPCA inflation calculated by excluding household food items and regulated prices reached 1.13% in March, as compared to 1.00% in February, breaking the deceleration observed since December. The accumulated change in 12 months reached 10.2%, as compared to 9.4% in February.
7. Core IPCA inflation calculated under the trimmed-mean method registered a 1.23% increase in March, as compared to 0.93% in the previous month. In the last 12 months, trimmed-mean core inflation accumulated a 10.8% increase, as compared to 10.1% in February. 8. Core IPC-BR inflation calculated under the symmetric trimmed-mean method increased 1.07% in March, as compared to 0.93% in the previous month, slightly above the 1.06% increase in the headline index for the month. In 12 months, core IPC-Br inflation accumulated a 10.6%increase, as compared to 9.94% in February.
9. In April, inflation may continue its recent declining trend, reflecting the dissipation of the effects of the recent increase in the prices of medicines, the reduction of agricultural prices and the recent behavior of the exchange rate, whose influence can be seen mainly in wholesale food prices. However, the drop in inflation will be attenuated by new readjustments of regulated prices, particularly household electricity tariffs, with increases in Belo Horizonte, Fortaleza, Salvador, Recife, and Porto Alegre.
10. The identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available information. The scenario considered in the simulations assumes the following hypotheses: a. Estimated price adjustments for gasoline and bottled gas for 2003 have fallen since the last Copom meeting to 8.4% from 12.4% and to 1.6% from 4.2%, respectively. These projections incorporate the adjustments of the first months of the year and price reduction from May onward. b. With respect to household electricity tariffs, estimated readjustments have decreased by 3 p.p. to 24.5%. This decrease is the result of the appreciation of the real observed since the last Copom meeting. c. Regulated prices, which had a 28.6% weight in the March IPCA, are forecast to increase 15.3% in 2003. The appreciation of the real, lower adjustments for electricity and the decrease in the price of oil by-products were mostly responsible for the fall of 1.5 p.p. from the March projections for regulated prices. d. For 2004, the estimated readjustment for the set of regulated prices is 8.5%, a 0.5 p.p. fall compared to the projections at the last meeting. This result is a consequence of the decrease in the expectation of 2004 IGP-M. e. The projection for the 6-month spread over the Selic rate, following the specification of the VAR model using the Selic and swap rates in levels, is at 60 b.p. in the 3Q03, gradually rising until the end of 2004.
11. Regarding fiscal policy, it is assumed that the public sector will accomplish primary surplus target for this year and the following two years (4.25% of the GDP). The other related assumptions established in the March Copom meeting were maintained. 
12. Considering the baseline scenario hypotheses, including a steady interest rate at 26.5% p.a. and the exchange rate at the level prevailing on the eve of the Copom meeting, inflation is projected above the adjusted target of 8.5% for 2003.
13. Inflation remains on a downward trend. However, recent inflation results were above Copom projections and the medians of both market expectations and Top 5 (best forecasters) market expectations. The current results indicate a higher degree of inflation persistence, which is key for the disinflation outlook. 
14. In March, free market prices increased as a result of price increases in items that are sensitive to past exchange rate changes, such as medicines and cleaning and hygiene products, as well as increases in perishable food prices. With the exception of ‘Services’ prices, which have a 20.6% weight in the index, all the other sub-groups in the IPCA posted relatively high levels of inflation. As a result, the monthly increase of core inflation was above 1%. 
15. The slower decline in inflation indicates a higher degree of inertia in the formation of prices in the economy, although this may be a temporary phenomenon. The degree of inflation inertia depends directly on the link between price and wage readjustments. There is a risk of future price and wage readjustments being based on accumulated inflation instead of on future inflation.
16. Other factors that impact consumer price inflation, such as the exchange rate and economic activity, have been contributing to a more rapid convergence of inflation to its targets.
17. Recent figures on economic activity, when adjusted for the distortions provoked by the timing of the Carnival holiday this year, show signs of a downturn in the first quarter of 2003. This trend has materialized despite the increase of exports and domestic production of import-substituting goods. The decline in activity can be attributed to the decrease in real wages and tightening of credit conditions for consumers. Leading indicators for March suggest that the level of activity will remain weak.
18. The nominal exchange rate appreciated around 12% in the period following the last Copom meeting as a result of improvement in the BoP. The trade surplus increased, and the current account registered a surplus in 1Q03, indicating a deepening of the external adjustment of the Brazilian economy. The sustainability of this trend, however, is dependent on a reduction of inflation, which is needed in order to preserve the change in relative prices that has occurred in the last year.
19. External funding conditions have improved. Brazil risk measured by the Embi+ has decreased more than 200 b.p. since the last Copom meeting, in line with the onshore yield curve. External funding from private sources has resumed, and March rollover rates for notes and commercial paper reached 82%, as compared to 65% in the same period of 2002. It is important, however, to achieve an improvement in the quality of external funding, with longer tenors and lower costs. Indeed, in April, new issues were announced with a slight lengthening of tenors. Demand for domestic securities has also increased, allowing the Treasury to issue LTNs and LFTs with longer maturities
20. These factors contributed to an improvement in the inflation outlook, even taking into consideration the failure of inflation to fall more sharply in recent months. As a result, the Copom decided to maintain the target for the Selic rate at 26.5%. 
21. The Copom also decided to withdraw the upward bias, which allowed the Governor to increase the Selic rate anytime between regular Copom meetings. Although there are doubts about the speed of the decline in inflation and questions regarding the extent to which the increase in inflation inertia is temporary or permanent, they will not be clarified between the monthly meetings, but over the longer term.
22. At the closing of the meeting, it was announced that the Committee would meet again on May 20, for technical presentations and on the following day, in order to discuss the monetary policy decision, as established in the Communiqué 10,187, of October 2, 2002.
"
30/05/2003;84;Henrique Meirelles;"1. In April, most measures of inflation registered their smallest monthly increases since September of 2002. This development was most pronounced in wholesale price indices, mainly due to the effects of the recent exchange rate appreciation and seasonal contribution of agricultural goods prices. The decline in consumer price inflation was smaller, reflecting a modest deceleration in market price inflation and increases in regulated prices. 
2. The IPCA increased 0.97% in April, in comparison to 1.23% in the previous month, accumulating 6.15% in the first four months of 2003 and 16.77% in 12 months. The IGP-DI increased 0.41% in April, compared to 1.66% in March. The IPA-DI rose by 0.07% in April, in comparison to 1.93% in the previous month. The 12-month increase of the IGP-DI and IPA-DI fell after having increased for eleven consecutive months, totaling 32.37% and 42.65%, respectively. 
3. The deceleration of IPCA inflation resulted exclusively from the evolution of market prices, which increased 0.87% in April, compared to 1.29% in March. Among market prices, the main contribution to the slowdown came from food prices, thanks particularly to the normalization of the supply of perishable foods, reflecting more favorable weather conditions. As a consequence, prices of perishable food increased 1.78% in April, in comparison to 7.17% in March. Among tradable goods apart from food items, the smaller increase of the IPCA was due to the behavior of the prices of medicines, household goods and cleaning and personal hygiene products, which increased less than in the previous month. However, due to seasonal effects, clothing items posted a higher increase in April (1.03%) than in March (0.6%). 
4. Regulated prices increased 1.21% in April, up from 1.08% in March, contributing 0.35 p.p. to the IPCA result in the month. An increase in the price of electricity made the largest single contribution to the increase in the IPCA (0.13 p.p), reflecting tariff hikes in six metropolitan regions. Additionally, urban bus tariffs, bottled cooking gas (whose price remained stable at the refinery level), water and sewage tariffs and the price of airplane tickets all registered increases. 
5. Regarding the evolution of wholesale prices, one should highlight the effects of the exchange rate appreciation and the normalization of the supply of perishable foods. The agricultural component of the IPA decreased 0.99% in April, after a 0.3% increase in March, mainly due to declines in the prices of fruits and legumes (7.05%) and export crops (5.49%). The industrial component of the IPA increased 0.48%, compared to 2.56% in March, reflecting the deceleration of price increases in most of the industrial sectors. 
6. Core IPCA inflation calculated by excluding household food items and regulated prices was 0.81% in April, compared to 1.13% in March, but still above the levels observed in the first three quarters of 2002. The accumulated change in 12 months was 10.53%. 
7. Core IPCA inflation calculated under the trimmed-mean method registered a 1.10% increase in April, higher than the headline index. In the last 12 months, trimmed-mean core inflation accumulated an increase of 11.43%, as compared to 10.8% in March. 
8. Core IPC-Br inflation calculated under the symmetric trimmed-mean method registered a 1.2% increase in April. In 12 months, core IPC-Br inflation accumulated a 11.37% increase. 
9. In May, the positive effects of the exchange rate appreciation on inflation are likely to increase, particularly on wholesale prices, as signaled by recent previews of the IGP-M. With respect to consumer prices, tradable goods will also benefit from the exchange rate appreciation, and in conjunction with the fall of perishable food and fuel prices will contribute to the downward trend of inflation. However, upward pressures from clothing prices and electricity tariffs (due to both increase of household electricity and implementation of public light tariffs) will prevent this effect from being more pronounced. 
10. The identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available information. The scenario considered in the simulations assumes the following hypothesis: 
a. Estimated price adjustments for gasoline in 2003 are around 6%, including the reduction at the beginning of May. The projection for the readjustment of the price of bottled cooking gas for 2003 increased to 4.5%, due to the 4.13% increase in April. 
b. With respect to household electricity tariffs, estimated readjustments decreased again as a result of the exchange rate appreciation, reaching 23.7% for 2003. This rate could be lower, were it not for the charges of public lighting in several capitals, including Curitiba, São Paulo, Fortaleza, Recife, Belo Horizonte, Goiânia and some municipalities of greater Rio de Janeiro. 
c. Regulated prices, which had a 28.6% weight in the April IPCA, are forecast to increase 14.9% in 2003. Despite the increase of in the projection for bottled cooking gas, the decrease of gasoline prices, the exchange rate appreciation and the consequent reassessment of electricity price readjustment resulted in a 0.4 p.p. fall from the April projections for regulated prices. 
d. The projection for the 6-month spread over the Selic rate, following the specification of the VAR model using the Selic and swap rates on the eve of the Copom meeting was 80 b.p. for 4Q03, gradually rising to 150 b.p. at the end of 2004. 
11. Regarding fiscal policy, it is assumed that the public sector will accomplish the primary surplus target for this year and the following two years (4.25% of the GDP). The other related assumptions established in the April Copom meeting were maintained. 
12. Considering the baseline scenario hypotheses, including a steady interest rate at 26.5% p.a. and the exchange rate at the level prevailing on the eve of the Copom meeting, inflation is projected above the adjusted target of 8.5% for 2003. 
13. Inflation remains on a downward trend. Wholesale price inflation has been decreasing more than consumer price inflation. There is evidence that the dynamics of the two groups of prices have been different. At the wholesale level, the exchange rate appreciation and the normalization of the supply of perishable food have been the main factors underlying the decrease in inflation. 
14. However, the deceleration of consumer price inflation has not been as significant. Regulated prices increased by 0.34 p.p. more than market prices, due to items such as water and sewage, bottled cooking gas, electricity, urban bus fares, airplane tickets, motor oil and cellular phones. Market price inflation declined, largely due to smaller price increases in services and items linked to the exchange rate. 
15. GDP may close the first quarter of 2003 roughly stable in comparison to the previous quarter. On the one hand, manufacturing output fell. On the other hand, the mineral extraction industry, the agricultural sector and the tradable goods sector registered positive performance. 
16. The resistance to a more rapid decline in consumer price inflation points to the existence of increased inflation persistence in the economy. The prices of important groups in the consumption basket have increased significantly, although at a decelerating rate, including beverages, canned products, cleaning and personal hygiene products and furniture and utensils. Consequently, core inflation still remains at a high level. 
17. This persistence is due to wage and price readjustments that have occurred since the beginning of the year and that have been based on the high inflation rate accumulated in the last twelve months, rather than assessments of future inflation. Also, businesses have made an effort to regain profit margins in a scenario of falling aggregated demand. This behavior resulted in a significant decrease in sales. Retail sales decreased 6% in the first quarter of the year compared to the same period of the previous year. 
18. The Copom believes that monetary policy should not ratify price and wage readjustments based on past inflation, due to the risk of perpetuating higher inflation. 
19. There are initial signs that monetary policy is curbing inflation. The Copom as well as market participants expect inflation to maintain a declining trend towards its target. These favorable expectations regarding inflation are based on the following assumptions: (i) inflation persistence is temporary, (ii) the recent exchange rate appreciation positively affects price dynamics (in the same way that the exchange rate depreciation affected inflation). 
20. Since inflation remains relatively high, it is still premature to conclude that inflation persistence is definitively decreasing and that the effect of the exchange rate appreciation on prices is significant. Thus, the Copom concludes that the decrease of inflation depends on the maintenance of its current effort. 
21. As a result, the Copom decided, unanimously, to maintain the target for the Over-Selic rate at 26.5% p.a. 
22. At the closing of the meeting, it was announced that the Copom would meet again on June 17, for technical presentations and on the following day, in order to discuss the monetary policy decision, as established in the Communiqué 10,187, of October 2, 2002.
"
27/06/2003;85;Henrique Meirelles;"1. In May, most measures of inflation continued their downward trend. Wholesale prices fell, mainly due to the effects of the recent exchange rate appreciation, especially on the prices of tradable goods. Consumer prices on average are also decelerating, although at a slower rate than at the wholesale level, reflecting pressures on specific items. 
2. The IPCA increased 0.61% in May, in comparison to 0.97% in the previous month, accumulating 6.80% in 2003 and 17.24% in 12 months. The IGP-DI decreased 0.67% in May, compared to a 0.41% increase in April. The IPA-DI fell by 1.68% in May, in comparison to 0.07% in the previous month. The 12-month IGP-DI and IPA-DI fell for the second consecutive month, totaling 30.05% and 38.5%, respectively in comparison to 32.37% and 42.65% in April. 
3. Regarding the evolution of the IPCA, the average increase of 6.45% in electricity due to both increases in household electricity tariffs and public lighting taxes in some capitals made the largest single contribution (0.27 p.p.) to the increase of the IPCA in May. The 14.46% increase in the price of rice also contributed significantly to IPCA inflation in May. 
4. Inflation of both market and regulated prices in the IPCA slowed in May. The increase in market prices fell to 0.53% in May from 0.87% in April due to the deceleration of inflation in non-tradable goods prices, which remained stable – mainly due to declines in the prices of perishable foods and a 0.3% increase in service prices. The slowdown of inflation in tradable goods prices was less intense, with these prices rising 0.95% in May compared to 1.11% in April, with continuing upward pressures from the prices of rice, milk and dairy products and clothing. Among tradable goods, there was a deceleration in the price increases of medicine, cleaning and personal hygiene products, furniture and utensils and electronics. 
5. Regulated prices increased 0.81% in May, compared to 1.21% in April, contributing 0.23 p.p. to the increase of the IPCA. In addition to electricity tariff hikes in 9 regions, urban bus and water and sewage tariffs contributed 0.08 p.p. and 0.03 p.p., respectively, to the increase in the May IPCA. Gasoline prices at gas stations decreased 3.38% due to a 6.5% decline in refinery prices that began on April 30th. The price of alcohol-based auto fuel decreased 3.88% in May. Together gasoline and alcohol-based fuel contributed –0.20 p.p. to the change in the IPCA last month. 
6. It is important to highlight that even after the most recent reductions in petroleum products, domestic prices are still higher than international prices. Considering the international dollar prices of these products and the exchange rate on June 15th, these margins stood at 8.5% for gasoline prices and bottled gas, 24% for diesel fuel and 13.8% for jet fuel. 
7. Regarding the evolution of wholesale prices, one should highlight the effects of the exchange rate appreciation on both agricultural and industrial prices. Following a 0.99% decrease in April, the agricultural component of the IPA fell a further 3.08% in May. The industrial component of the IPA decreased 1.15% in May, compared to a 0.48% increase in the previous month. However, the behavior of industrial prices at the wholesale level was not uniform, with a deceleration of price increases in some sectors, outright price declines in others - mainly chemicals, paper and cardboard and power lines - and higher pressures in sectors such as machinery, transportation, fabric, clothes and footwear, beverages and food products. 
8. Core IPCA inflation calculated by excluding household food items and regulated prices was 0.56% in May, compared to 0.81% in April. The accumulated change in 12 months was 10.58%. 
9. Core IPCA inflation calculated under the trimmed-mean method registered 1% in May, compared to 1.1% in April. In the last 12 months, trimmed-mean core inflation accumulated an increase of 11.98%. It is worth mentioning that because of the methodology used in this measure - in particular, smoothing the changes of certain items - the results are influenced by the higher inflation resulting from the exchange rate depreciation in the second half of 2002. 
10. Core IPC-BR inflation calculated under the symmetric trimmed-mean method registered a 1.05% increase in May. In 12 months, core IPC-BR inflation accumulated a 12.14% increase. Core measures of inflation with this index are also being influenced by the exchange rate shock last year. 
11. In June, wholesale prices will continue to reflect the exchange rate appreciation, registering additional declines as already signaled in the partial results for June inflation. Consumer price indices will come under some upward pressure from the prices of rice, milk and dairy products and clothing prices. However, this pressure will be lower than observed in May. Also, expected declines in the prices of fresh food, beef and fuel will facilitate a further deceleration of monthly inflation. 
12. The identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available information. The scenario considered in the simulations assumes the following hypotheses. 
a. The price of gasoline is estimated to increase 5.3% in 2003, compared to 6% at the last Copom meeting. Re-estimates of the price adjustments for bottled cooking gas for 2003 resulted in a 2.1 p.p. fall compared to last month, with cooking gas now forecasted to increase 2.4% in 2003. These forecasts include price readjustments that have occurred up to the current date. 
b. As a result of the exchange rate appreciation and the new estimate for the General Price Indices, the readjustments of electricity and telephones tariffs are estimated at 23% and 19%, respectively, including the readjustments that have occurred up to the current date. 
c. Regulated prices, which had a 28.65% weight in the May IPCA, are forecast to increase 14.1% in 2003. The exchange rate appreciation and the decrease in the estimate of electricity and telephone price readjustments resulted in a 0.8 p.p. fall from the May projections. Regulated prices are forecast to increase 8.9% in 2004. 
d. The projection for the 6-month spread over the Selic rate, following the specification of the VAR model using the Selic and swap rates on the eve of the Copom meeting, was -100 b.p. for 3Q03, gradually rising to 50 b.p. at the end of 2004. 
13. Regarding fiscal policy, it is assumed that the public sector will accomplish the primary surplus target for this year and the following two years (4.25% of the GDP). The other related assumptions established in the May Copom meeting were maintained. 
14. Considering the baseline scenario hypotheses, including maintenance of the Selic interest rate at 26.5% p.a. and the exchange rate at the level prevailing on the eve of the Copom meeting, inflation is projected above the adjusted target of 8.5% for 2003 and below the target of 5.5% for 2004. 
15. Monthly Inflation has been falling this year. There are three basic factors explaining this recent behavior. First, the high inflation rates observed at the beginning of the year resulted from the delayed effects on prices of the strong exchange rate depreciation observed last year and the increase of inflation persistence, with more agents adjusting prices and wages based on past inflation. Second, the recent exchange rate appreciation has reduced pressures on companies’ costs and wholesale prices. Although there is still some resistance among the retail prices of tradable goods to pass-through from the recent exchange rate appreciation, consumer prices have tended to stabilize without additional readjustment pressures. Third, monetary policy has been successful in reducing inflation expectations and inflation pressures by controlling aggregate demand. 
16. Inflation persistence contributed to the continuation of high inflation in the initial months of the year. Higher inflation persistence was caused by an increase in the practice of backward-looking prices readjustment, and a corresponding decline in price readjustments based on future inflation. This behavior, aimed at improving profit margins in the initial months of the year, led to a significant decrease in sales in an environment of lower demand and a monetary policy committed to preventing price readjustments from perpetuating high inflation. 
17. As a consequence of higher inflation persistence, the velocity of the fall of monthly inflation has been lower than expected since inflation peaked at 3% in November. IPCA inflation only dropped below 1% in April, falling again in May to 0.61%. Similar behavior has been observed when analyzing the trend of market prices. The inflation of these items has decreased gradually, to 0.5% in May from 2.5% in November. 
18. On the other hand, the exchange rate appreciation has contributed to a reduction of cost pressures on inflation. The maintenance of appropriate fiscal and monetary policies, as well as the recent increase in international liquidity, contributed to the continuation of the exchange rate appreciation. The rollover rates for private securities and direct loans continue to increase. Country risk, measured by the Embi+, continued its decline, falling to 696 b.p. on the eve of the June Copom meeting from 833 b.p. on the eve of the May Copom meeting, demonstrating the recovery of international confidence in the conduct of economic policy in Brazil. 
19. Economic activity continues to decelerate. The intensity and duration of this deceleration are similar to those observed in other recent periods of Brazilian history. However, due to the change in relative prices, especially regarding the prices of tradable goods compared to the prices of non-tradables, the deceleration of activity is not uniform. The sectors related to exports, including agribusiness, and the mineral extraction industry are expanding. On the other hand, the durable goods sector for internal consumers, which depends on domestic credit conditions, is the most depressed compared to the same month of last year. 
20. According to the factors explained above, monthly inflation remains on a downward trend. The decrease of 0.4 p.p. in IPCA inflation in May was strongly influenced by the 0.6 p.p. reduction in non-tradable goods prices, which resulted mainly from the normalization of the supply of perishable foods. Nevertheless, other groups also showed a reduction of inflation pressures. The decrease of the prices of gasoline and alcohol-based auto fuel was the main factor contributing to the reduction in regulated price inflation. Excluding the increases in electricity, urban bus, water and sewage tariffs, the IPCA would have increased by 0.23% instead of the 0.61% observed in May. The decline of consumer price inflation was followed by deflation in wholesale prices, both agricultural and industrial. 
21. Also in May, fewer prices in the IPCA were adjusted upward: 66.0% compared to 75.8% in April. This value is much lower than the maximum value of the series since 1995, observed in January, when the prices of 85.9% of the items in the IPCA increased. 
22. Core inflation is also declining. Free prices (which is equivalent to a core inflation calculated by excluding regulated prices) increased 0.53% in May, compared to 0.87% in April, pointing to annualized inflation of 6.9%. The behavior of core inflation calculated by excluding regulated prices and household food items was similar, decreasing to 0.56% in May from 0.81% in April. 
23. Trimmed-mean core inflation increased 1%, compared to 1.1% in April. Under this methodology, the readjustments of some items, which are concentrated in a few short periods of the year, are smoothed to avoid their exclusion from the core. When inflationary shocks occur, the core tends to be affected by past pressures and shows some resistance to falling. Excluding the effects produced by this smoothing process, the downward trend of core inflation is clear, falling from 0.86% in April to 0.64% in May. Another way to measure trimmed-mean core inflation, which avoids the influence of exchange rate shocks, is to substitute the current period’s smoothed values with the corresponding values observed in the past 12 months. Based on this criterion, the core would be 0.88% and 0.79% in April and May respectively. 
24. Both the Central Bank’s inflation forecasts and market inflation expectations have been converging to the inflation targets. The Central Bank’s inflation forecasts for 2003 point to inflation above the adjusted target of 8.5%. Nonetheless, inflation in the second quarter of the year registered results compatible with those presented in the Open Letter sent by the Central Bank’s Governor to the Ministry of Finance on January 21. 
25. Market inflation expectations surveyed by Gerin have also been converging to the 12-month ahead inflation targets. The most recent data regarding inflation expectations for the next 12 months is 7.4%, close to the 12-month ahead target path in May (7.2%). 
26. In June 2003, the 12 month-ahead inflation consistent with the 2003 and 2004 targets corresponds to 7%. The Copom inflation forecast for the same period is below this figure. 
27. However, there are still risks to setting inflation on a path consistent with the target trajectory, especially with respect to the speed of disinflation. The Copom has continuously evaluated the degree of inflation persistence in recent months. One of the analytic methods consists of comparing the models that are currently used with other specifications that adopt a higher degree of persistence. It was observed that the current models forecasted May inflation with more accuracy, which may be the first hint that the degree of inflation persistence is returning to the historical average. The asymmetrical impact on prices of the exchange rate’s appreciation and depreciation was analyzed in the same way. The conclusion was that the models that incorporate less impact due to exchange rate appreciations, compared to exchange rate depreciations, signaled market price inflation above the one that was effective in May. 
28. Due to the recent slowdown in inflation, the Copom believes that the stance of monetary policy should ensure that the recent disinflation trend is sustained. 
"
31/07/2003;86;Henrique Meirelles;"1. In June, inflation continued its downward trend, with wholesale and consumer price indices posting negative changes. The fall of wholesale prices for the second consecutive month reflected the
effects of an increase in the supply of cereals and grains due to the new harvest season, and th  effect of the recent exchange rate appreciation on agricultural and industrial prices. Regarding consumer prices, the slowdown in inflation was also general, but the negative change observed in June was the result of the sharp decline in fuel and food prices.
2. The IPCA fell 0.15% in June, after an increase of 0.61% in the previous month, accumulating a 6.64% increase in 2003. The IGP-DI fell 0.70% in June, compared to a decrease of 0.67% in May, while the IPA-DI fell 1.16% in June from 1.68% in May. In the twelve months ending in June, the IPCA increased 16.57%, the first reduction in the 12-month accumulated change since August 2002. The 12-month changes of the IGP-DI and IPA-DI decreased for the third consecutive month in June, reaching 26.94% and 33.55%, respectively, compared to 30.05% and 38.50%, observed in May.
3. Regarding the IPCA, the negative change observed in June was determined by the fall in gasoline, alcohol-based auto fuel and food prices, which together contributed –0.45 p.p. to the overall result. The price of rice increased 6.2% in June, compared to an increase of 14.46% in May, as a result of the continuing effects of decreased production in the South of Brazil. Even with the substantial fall in growth between the two months, the increase in the price of rice registered the highest positive individual contribution to the increase in the IPCA in June (0.06 p.p.).
4. Inflation of market prices in the IPCA slowed again in June, while the inflation of regulated prices reversed their recent positive changes. Market price inflation slowed to 0.20% in June from 0.53% in May, while the level of regulated prices actually decreased 1.02% in June, compared to an increase of 0.81% in May.
5. The deceleration of market price inflation was due mainly to the 0.34% decline in food prices, even with upward pressures from increases in the prices of rice, milk and dairy products. The decrease in food prices was influenced by the increased supply of sugar cane, beans and corn. This increased supply of corn affected meat prices, mainly chicken, which decreased 2.3%. Regarding sugar, the decrease of international prices prevailed. Conditions for perishable food production remained favorable in June, supporting the average fall of 8.0% in these prices, after a decrease of 6.3% in May. Excluding food items, market prices increased 0.47% in June compared to 0.48% in May, reflecting the seasonal acceleration of increases in clothes prices, which counteracted the general deceleration of market price inflation.
6. Regulated prices fell 1.02% in June compared to a rise of 0.81% in May, contributing -0.29 p.p. to the overall result of the IPCA in June. Gasoline prices at gas stations decreased 4.9%, as a result of the continuing effects of the 6.5% reduction at the refinery level since April 30. The decline of alcohol-based fuel prices intensified in June, reaching 12.1%, due to the increased supply of sugar cane, the decrease of international sugar prices and the recent exchange rate appreciation.
7. Wholesale prices posted a negative change for the second consecutive month, both in agricultural and industrial prices. The agricultural IPA’s 1.04% decline was smaller than the 3.08% drop in May as a consequence of upward pressures from meat and meat-products. The increased supply of grains, vegetables and fruits continued to contribute to the decrease of the prices of these products. The industrial IPA fell 1.21%, after a decrease of 1.15% in May. The result was influenced by further decreases in the prices of chemical products, particularly fuel, lubricants and fertilizers, and negative changes in important segments such as food products, plastic, metallurgical and electronic materials, paper and corrugated paper, fabric and clothing. On the other hand, increases in the prices of industrial mineral products, beverages, furnishings, wood, rubber and non-metallic minerals should be highlighted.
8. Core IPCA inflation calculated by excluding household food items and regulated prices, decreased to 0.52% in June from 0.56% in May. The accumulated change in the last twelve months reached 10.97%.
9. Core IPCA inflation calculated under the trimmed-mean method reached 0.9% in June, compared to 1.0% in May. In the last twelve months, the accumulated change increased to 12.5%, continuing to reflect the influence of higher inflation in the second half of 2002.
10. Core IPC-BR inflation, calculated under the symmetric trimmed-mean method increased 0.74% in June, compared to 1.05% in May, accumulating an increase of 12.51% in the twelve months through June. In this case core inflation is also influenced by the higher inflation in the second half of 2002.
11. In July, the effect of the exchange rate depreciation on wholesale prices will decline, with agricultural and industrial prices likely to register less deflation. Agricultural prices may also reflect increasing pressures in meat, milk and dairy products prices due to seasonal effects. Only the prices of the products in the sugarcane derivatives industry may continue to decline. The decrease of 0.42% in agricultural prices registered in the second preview of the July IGP-M, compared to 1.5% in the second preview of June, already reflects these effects. 
12. Consumer price indices will be impacted by the increase in regulated prices, particularly the readjustment of electricity tariffs in São Paulo and telephone tariffs around the country. The negative contribution of fuel and food prices will decrease in July. Regarding clothing, the recently seen pressures are expected to reverse due to early winter sales. 
13. The identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available information. The scenario considered in the simulations assumes the following hypotheses:
a. The projections for the readjustment of gasoline prices in the remainder of 2003 decreased by 5.2 p.p. since the last meeting. The new projection for this year’s readjustment is +0.1%. The projections for bottled cooking gas for 2003 remained almost stable, with a 0.1 p.p. reduction between the June and July meetings. These forecasts include price readjustments that have occurred up to the current date,
b. The projections for the readjustment of electricity tariffs fell slightly, to 21% from 23%, already including the readjustments that have occurred up to the current date. Regarding telephone tariffs, the new forecast presumes a 25.5% readjustment in 2003,
c. Regulated prices, which had a 28.7% weight in the June IPCA, are forecast to rise 13.1% in 2003, a 1.0 p.p. decrease compared to last month’s projection, despite the significant increase in the forecast for the readjustment of telephone tariffs. This drop in the projection continues to be a consequence of the exchange rate appreciation observed in recent months. Gasoline, alcohol-based auto fuel and household electricity tariffs were the major prices responsible for the decrease in the projection for the increase in overall regulated prices in 2003,
d. For 2003, it is assumed that the readjustment of regulated prices will follow the endogenous determination model of regulated prices, which considers the change in the exchange rate, free price inflation and the change in the IGP price index, as well as seasonal factors. Under this new methodology, the projection for the readjustment of regulated prices in 2004 is 9.6%,
e. The projection for the 6-month spread over the Selic rate, following the specification of the VAR model using the Selic and the swap rate on the eve of the Copom meeting, was –340 b.p. for the third quarter of 2003, gradually rising to 40 b.p. at the end of 2004. 
14. Regarding fiscal policy, it is assumed that the primary surplus target of 4.25% of GDP for this year and the following two years will be accomplished. The other related assumptions established in the June meeting were maintained.
15. Considering the baseline scenario hypotheses, including the maintenance of the Selic interest rate at 26.0% p.a. and the exchange rate at the level prevailing on the eve of the Copom meeting (R$2.85), inflation is projected above the adjusted target of 8.5% for 2003 and below the target of 5.5% for 2004.
16. Monthly inflation has continued the declines observed in recent months. This positive outcome is mainly the result of monetary initiatives that impeded the propagation of the shocks that occurred at the end of 2002, and to consistency in fiscal policy. These factors, together with a more favorable international environment, led to an exchange rate appreciation in the period and to a convergence of inflation expectations to the path of the targets. The significant drop of inflation illustrated by the results of the IPCA in June and the IPCA-15 in July provides evidence of the effectiveness of monetary policy in reducing inflation persistence, and preventing its continuation at high levels. Additionally, these results strengthen the perception that the convergence of inflation to the targets is occurring more rapidly than had been observed up to April.
17. The 0.15% decline of the IPCA in June was a result of a 1.02% drop in regulated prices and a 0.20% increase in free prices. These numbers benefited from several conjunctural and seasonal factors, such as declines in gasoline, alcohol-based auto fuel and food prices. Though such factors should be taken under consideration, market prices show a clear deceleration of inflation. Excluding food, market price inflation remained between 0.45% and 0.50% in May and June compared to 0.81% in April.
18. Several measures of core inflation dropped between May and June, as described above. A similar trend was seen in other price indices, such as the IPC-Fipe, which showed a drop in inflation for the fifth consecutive month.
19. The outright fall of the IPCA in June was accompanied by a lower proportion of individual prices in the IPCA showing positive readjustments: 60.4% compared to 66.0% in May. The June rate is significantly smaller than the 85.9% registered in January, the highest value in the series since 1995, and is lower than the average of 63.7% observed since January of 1999.
20. The behavior of the exchange rate has contributed to the drop of inflation. Between June and July, the exchange rate remained almost stable, with the US dollar floating between R$2.80 and R$2.90. Country risk measured by the Embi+ increased slightly since the eve of the June Copom meeting, to 726 b.p. from 696 b.p.. The rollover rates for private securities and external loans continue to increase. In June, the IPA, which is strongly related to the exchange rate, posted deflation. This was the second consecutive month of deflation in the case of the industrial subcomponent of the IPA, and the third consecutive month in the case of the agricultural subcomponent of the IPA.
21. However, the effects on tradable goods prices of the exchange rate appreciation that has occurred since the beginning of 2003 have so far been less intense than expected. As the behavior of wholesale prices have a partial and delayed effect on consumer prices, there is still room for the exchange rate appreciation that has occurred since the beginning of 2003 to affect the IPCA, even though the exchange rate has remained stable around current levels for the past month. As a result, although tradable goods prices do not yet embody all of the exchange rate appreciation that has occurred, it is reasonable to expect that they will adjust further in the absence of additional upward pressures.
22. The deceleration in economic activity has continued, with a decline in retail sales, an increase in inventories, and zero growth in industrial production. The unemployment rate measured by the IBGE increased in May to 12.8%. Because it is based upon a new methodology, the May unemployment rate is not directly comparable to the value observed in the same month of past years. It should be highlighted that some of the indicators available in the Copom meeting still reflect the lagged impacts on economic activity of the adverse macroeconomic environment prevailing in the final months of 2002 and in the first months of 2003. The Copom remains aware of the evolution of the level of activity and believes that the recent deceleration will be reversed in the second half of 2003, as a result of the effects of the recent significant improvement in the macroeconomic fundamentals.
23. Both the Central Bank’s inflation forecasts and market inflation expectations have been converging to the inflation targets. The Central Bank’s inflation forecasts for 2003 point to inflation above the adjusted target of 8.5%. Nonetheless, as observed at the June Copom meeting, since the second quarter of this year inflation has registered results compatible with the projections presented in the Open Letter sent by the Central Bank’s Governor to the Ministry of Finance on January 21, 2003.
24. The median of market expectations for inflation surveyed by Gerin has also been converging to the inflation targets. In the weeks before the July Copom meetings, expected inflation for the next 12- months dropped to 7.0% from 7.7%, a value that is consistent with the 12-month ahead path of the inflation targets from July. In the same period the median of market expectation for 2004 inflation dropped to 6.5% from 7.4%.
25. The Central Bank’s inflation forecasts, considering the baseline scenario hypotheses, including a Selic rate at 26.0% p.a. and the exchange rate at the level of R$2.85, point to an inflation rate accumulated in the next twelve months below the trajectory of the inflation targets. For 2004, the forecast is below the new target of 5.5% fixed by the CMN at the end of June. However, during periods of disinflation, nominal interest rates are expected to fall gradually, and therefore forecasts for relatively long time horizons based on constant nominal interest rates tend to overestimate the downward trajectory of inflation.
26. The Copom remains concerned about the risks to setting inflation on a path consistent with the trajectory of the targets, especially with respect to the degree of inflation persistence and to the speed of disinflation. The Copom has compared its inflation forecasts from the model currently in use with an alternative model that adopts a higher degree of inflation persistence. The inflation forecasts for the second quarter of 2003 adopting the current model were more precise, which provides more evidence that the degree of inflation persistence is converging towards its historical mean.
27. If the recent trend of inflation persists, real interest rates should converge to lower levels in the future. The gradual convergence of interest rates towards the new equilibrium levels in the medium term will preserve the recent success in fighting inflation and will be compatible with a sustained recovery in the level of economic activity.
28. Considering the forecasts for inflation in the next twelve months and 2004, the recent rates for the IPCA and the evidence that inflation persistence may be returning to its historical levels, the Copom believes that additional loosening of monetary policy will not compromise the recent success in reducing inflation.
"
29/08/2003;87;Henrique Meirelles;"1. Inflation rates in July reflected the lack of price pressures and confirmed the convergence to the inflation targets. Wholesale prices registered a negative change for the third consecutive month, although they fell by less than in the previous month. Consumer price indices increased slightly, as a result of readjustments in specific regulated prices.
2. The IPCA increased 0.20% in July, after a decrease of 0.15% in the previous month, accumulating increases of 6.85% and 15.43% in 2003 and in 12 months, respectively. The IGP-DI fell 0.20% in July, compared to a decrease of 0.70% in June, reflecting an increase of the IPC-BR (to 0.34% in July from –0.16% in June) and a decrease of the IPA-DI (to –0.59% from –1.16%). The 12-month changes of the IGP-DI and IPA-DI decreased for the fourth consecutive month in July, reaching 24.14% and 29.12% respectively.
3. IPCA market price inflation slowed again in July (to -0.01% from 0.20% in June), as a consequence of a larger decline of food prices. Regulated prices rose 0.73% in July, compared to a decrease of 1.02% in the previous month, contributing 0.21 p.p. to the overall result of the IPCA in July. The rise of 9% in national fixed telephone tariffs was the main reason for the increase of regulated prices. In addition, there was an average increase of 2.1% in energy tariffs. Gasoline and alcohol-based auto fuel prices fell again in July, -2.7% and -10.3% respectively, together contributing -0.23 p.p. to the overall result of the IPCA.
4. Wholesale prices posted a negative change for the third consecutive month, as a consequence of a decrease in both agricultural and industrial prices. The agricultural IPA fell 0.42% in July, after a decrease of 1.04% in June. The industrial IPA decreased 0.66% in July, compared to a decrease of 1.21% in June.
5. Core IPCA inflation calculated by excluding household food items and regulated prices, fell to 0.37% in July from 0.52% in June. The accumulated change in the last twelve months reached 10.83%, decreasing from the previous month for the first time this year.
6. Core IPCA inflation calculated under the trimmed-mean method (smoothed) reached 0.65% in July, compared to 0.87% in June. In the last twelve months, the accumulated change increased to 12.67%, continuing to reflect the influence of higher inflation in the second half of 2002. Inflation calculated without the smoothing procedure for pre-selected items resulted in rates of 0.40% and 11.71% in the month and in 12 months, respectively.
7. Core IPC-BR inflation calculated under the symmetric trimmed-mean method reached 0.53% in July, accumulating an increase of 12.65% in the twelve months ending in July.
8. Despite some specific pressures, the trend indicates stable prices in August. The trajectory of food prices should be less favorable mainly due to the increase of meat prices and to the deceleration of the fall in the prices of beans, perishable foods and soybean products. Among regulated prices, gasoline stopped contributing to the fall of inflation. In addition, the increase of energy tariffs in Belém (August 7) and São Paulo (July 4) will contribute to an increase in inflation. On the other hand, the effects of the increase in telephone prices, considering the current judicial stance, will end in August.
9. The identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available information. The scenario considered in the simulations assumes the following hypotheses:
a. The projections for the readjustment of gasoline prices in the remainder of 2003 were revised. The new projection for this year’s readjustment stands at 4.9%, a significant increase if compared with 0.1% in July. This increase results from the exchange rate depreciation in the last month and mainly the rise of international oil prices. The projections for bottled cooking gas for the remainder of the year was stable. However, considering the rise in prices that occurred in July, the projections for bottled cooking gas prices for the full year rose to 5.8% from 2.3%,
b. The projections for the readjustment of electricity tariffs increased to 22.3% from 21.0%. The projections for the readjustment of telephone tariffs in 2003 were maintained at 25.5% with a new distribution over the year. Due to the judicial injunction against the readjustment of these tariffs according to the IGP-DI annual variation, this item registered a change that was lower than expected in July. The Copom considered the hypothesis that differences between the authorized by Anatel and the actual readjustment will be compensated in the remainder of the year,
c. Regulated prices, which had a 28.5% weight in the July IPCA, are forecasted to rise 14.0% in 2003, a 0.9 p.p. increase compared to last month’s projection. The increase in this projection is a consequence of the rise in oil derivatives prices (gasoline and bottled cooking gas) and household electricity tariffs,
d. For 2004, it is assumed that the readjustment of regulated prices will follow the endogenous determination model of regulated prices. Under this methodology, which considers the change in the exchange rate, free price inflation and the change in the IGPDI, as well as seasonal factors, the projection for the readjustment of regulated prices in 2004 was reduced by 0.9 p.p., to 8.7%,
e. The projection for the 6-month spread over the Selic rate, following the specification of the VAR model using the Selic and the swap rate on the eve of the Copom meeting, was –260 b.p. for the third quarter of 2003, gradually rising to 50 b.p. at the end of 2004. 10. Regarding fiscal policy, it is assumed that the primary surplus target of 4.25% of the GDP for this year and the following two years will be accomplished. The other related assumptions established in the July meeting were maintained.
11. Considering the baseline scenario hypotheses, including the maintenance of the Selic interest rate at 24.5% p.a. and the exchange rate at the level prevailing on the eve of the Copom meeting (R$3.00), inflation is projected above the adjusted target of 8.5% for 2003 and below the target of 5.5% for 2004. 
12. The behavior of inflation in July proved over again that monetary policy has been able to establish the convergence of the inflation rate to the path of the inflation targets. This assessment is based not only on the 0.20% increase in the IPCA in July, but also on the persistent and quick fall of inflation expectations, on the exchange rate stability and on the favorable evolution of other price indices, both consumer and wholesale. These factors provide evidence of the effectiveness of monetary policy – within a framework of consistent macroeconomic policies - in reducing inflation persistence, and preventing the inflation rate from stabilizing at higher levels after it peaked in the final months of 2002.
13. The rise of the IPCA from –0.15% in June to 0.20% in July is the result only of higher inflation in regulated prices, which rose to 0.73% from –1.02%. It should be highlighted that this increase was expected in the face of the readjustment of household electricity and telephone tariffs in this period. Inflation in tradable goods has been falling in the last two months, from 0.95% in May to 0.38% in June and –0.06% in July. This is a consequence of the exchange rate appreciation that occurred in the second quarter of the year. Inflation in non-tradable goods was almost zero for the third consecutive month. As a result, market prices inflation, a weighted sum of tradable and nontradable price changes, has been falling since March and was zero in July. Another decline in the number of items in the IPCA that suffered price increases also occurred, from 60.4% in June to 57.2% in July, the lowest share since May 2001.
14. The change in inflation dynamics is also captured by the behavior of core inflation and wholesale price indices. Core IPCA inflation calculated under the trimmed-mean method with smoothing and excluding regulated prices fell for the fourth consecutive month. 
15. Deflation in wholesale prices occurred for the third consecutive month, although the degree of deflation lessened in July. This behavior was observed for both industrial and agricultural prices. Considering that the positive impact of the agricultural harvest on prices is almost exhausted and also that the exchange rate remained roughly stable in July, the deflation observed in July can be attributed to the lagged effects of the exchange rate appreciation since March in an environment of decelerating economic activity. Despite the small exchange rate depreciation that occurred since the July Copom meeting, there is still room for the deflation of wholesale prices to contribute to lower levels of inflation to consumers, especially in the case of tradable goods, even in the context of a recovery of economic activity.
16. The exchange rate depreciated since the July Copom meeting, from a range between R$2.80 and R$2.90 to R$3.00 per US$ in the weeks before the August meeting. Country risk measured by the Embi+ rose from 730 b.p. to 900 b.p. in the beginning of August due to a rapid increase in longterm US interest rates and higher volatility in the domestic scenario in the last weeks of July. The Embi+ then decreased to 750 b.p. on the eve of the August Copom meeting. The Brazilian external accounts continued to post positive results, with records in the trade balance due to export growth, a surplus in the current account, and a quick recovery of rollover rates for external loans. Moreover, the negative short-term impact of the rise in long-term US interest rates will likely be compensated by the positive effects of the faster growth of the US economy on the global economy in the medium-run. 
17. Due to the exchange rate depreciation observed since the July Copom meeting, the current level of the exchange rate is equivalent to the average value during the second quarter of the year. Additionally, according to BCB simulations, the exchange rate appreciation in the first semester of 2003 has not yet been totally passed through to prices. Thus, the recent exchange rate depreciation is not expected to produce inflationary pressure.
18. The level of economic activity continued to fall at the end of the second quarter. In June, industrial production fell by more than expected. Retail sales continued to decrease and industrial inventories were above desired levels. Installed capacity utilization stabilized around 80% and the unemployment rate remains high, around 13%. This does not mean that economic activity is in recession, since the deceleration is not generalized, and activity in some important sectors, such as agriculture and exports, has been growing strongly.
19. The prospects for economic activity in the second half of the year are better than the outcome in the first half. Economic activity, particularly in the last quarter of 2003, may benefit from the effects of the cuts in the Over-Selic rate at the last three Copom meetings and the recent reduction of reserve requirements on demand deposits. The increase of real incomes, which may result from the decrease in inflation, will be an important factor supporting economic activity. Due to the behavior of the economy in the second quarter, growth during the second half will take place from a lower base than was expected at the July Copom meeting, and with a large margin of idle capacity. Thus, the recovery can be balanced, with the resumption of consumption and investment without significant inflationary pressures.
20. The BCB’s inflation forecasts, assuming the maintenance of the Over-Selic rate at 24.5% p.a. and the exchange rate at R$3.00, point to inflation above the adjusted target of 8.5% for 2003. There was no significant change in inflation forecast for 2003, as the lower–than-expected inflation results in July were offset by the higher forecast for regulated prices through the end of the year. Thus, the inflation forecast remains compatible with that presented in the Open Letter sent by the BCB Governor to the Finance Minister on January 1, 2003.
21. The BCB’s inflation forecasts for the next twelve months and for 2004, still assuming that the exchange rate and the Over-Selic rate remain constant, point to values below the target trend. The impact of the decrease in interest rates and the exchange rate depreciation observed in the last month was compensated by the lower forecast for the readjustment of regulated prices in the next year and by the significant decline of inflation expectations.
22. The median of market inflation expectations has been behaving favorably. For 2003, market expectations decreased to 9.7% from 10.6%. Regarding expectations for inflation in the next twelve months, the decrease was to 6.4% from 7.0% between the weeks before the July and August Copom meetings, continuing the declining trend that had already been observed in June and July. With this reduction, inflation expectations for the next twelve months are below 6.75%, the value that corresponds to the path for the inflation targets in July 2004. Finally, for 2004, market expectations decreased to 6.2% from 6.5%, close to the target of 5.5% for the year. 
23. As in previous months, in an effort to evaluate the degree of inflation persistence, the Copom compared its inflation forecasts from the model currently in use with an alternative model that adopts a higher degree of inflation persistence. The inflation forecasts for July adopting the current model were more precise, which again provides evidence that the degree of inflation persistence is converging towards its historical mean.
24. Monetary policy should be guided to make inflation converge to the target path. In the medium run, there is a real interest rate yield curve that is consistent with the target. In periods of transition, such as the current stage, it is up to the monetary authority to establish a short-term interest rate trend that permits the gradual convergence of the real interest rate yield curve to the that the one prevailing in the medium-run, guaranteeing that inflation converges to the target with the lowest volatility in output. With the evidence that inflation is falling to the targeted path, it is natural that the spreads between real interest rates and their medium-run equilibrium values diminishes.
25. Considering the recent evolution of inflation and the perspectives for its future trend, as well as the significant improvement of the fiscal scenario in the medium and long run as a consequence of the reforms being discussed in Congress, the Copom believes that easing monetary policy is appropriate, promoting an adjustment in the Over-Selic rate to bring it to a trend consistent with the gradual convergence of the real interest rate yield curve to its equilibrium position.

25/09/2003;88;Henrique Meirelles;"1. The IPCA increased 0.34% in August, after an increase of 0.20% in the previous month, accumulating increases of 7.22% and 15.07% in 2003 and in 12 months, respectively. The IGP-DI increased 0.62% in August, compared to a decrease of 0.20% in July, reflecting an increase in the IPA-DI (+0.70% in August compared to -0.59% in July) and a deceleration of the IPC-BR (to 0.13% from 0.34%). The 12-month changes of the IGP-DI and IPA-DI decreased for the fifth consecutive month in August, reaching 22.03% and 25.85% respectively.
2. Regulated prices rose 0.85% in August, contributing 0.24 p.p. to the overall result of the IPCA, while free prices rose 0.14%, contributing 0.1 p.p. Among regulated prices, notable increases included fixed telephone and electricity tariffs, water and sewage tariffs, and the price of gasoline, which had been falling for five consecutive months. With respect to free prices, the most significant impacts came from increases in the prices of domestic services and meat. Food prices decreased 0.27% in August, less sharply than the 0.67% decline in the previous month.
3. Both agricultural and industrial wholesale prices rose in August. Agricultural prices increased 1.77%, reversing the declines observed in the previous four months, as a result of the beginning of an inter-harvest period and increases in the international prices of some commodities. The most significant pressures came from the prices of meat (cattle, pork and poultry) and meat-related products, coffee, manioc and rice. Industrial prices increased 0.29%, after falling in the previous three months, with notable increases in common steel plates, fuel oil, sulfur, sugar, roasted and ground coffee, and copper wires.
4. Core IPCA inflation calculated by excluding household food items and regulated prices increased 0.37% in August, repeating the change registered in July. The accumulated change in the last twelve months stood at 10.8%, decreasing for the second consecutive time.
5. Core IPCA inflation calculated under the trimmed-mean method (smoothed) reached 0.58% in August, compared to 0.65% in July. In the last twelve months, the accumulated change stood at 12.59%, decelerating for the first time this year. Inflation calculated without the smoothing procedure for pre-selected items resulted in rates of 0.35% and 11.47% in the month and in twelve months, respectively.
6. Core IPC-BR inflation calculated under the symmetric trimmed-mean method was 0.45% in August, accumulating an increase of 12.43% in the twelve months ending in August. 
7. In September, consumer price indices will post larger increases than in August, mainly reflecting pressures on regulated and food prices. Among regulated prices, water and sewage tariffs in São Paulo, electricity in Brasília and Goiânia and the second readjustment of urban transportation in Salvador should be highlighted, along with other items with countrywide impacts such as alcohol, gasoline and fixed telephone tariffs. Free prices will increase as a result of increases in food prices, which were seen in the wholesale indices in August.
8. It should be noted that the one-time price increases to be observed in the next few months, mainly due to regulated prices and seasonal pressures, do not represent any change in the process of disinflation that has been observed in recent months. This is highlighted by the continuing downward trend of core inflation.
9. The identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available information. The scenario considered in the simulations assumes the following hypotheses: 
a. The projections for the readjustment of gasoline prices in the remainder of 2003 were revised. The new projection for this year’s readjustment stands at 2.2%, 2.7 p.p. lower than in August. This decrease results mainly from the exchange rate appreciation in the last month and the fall of international oil prices. The projections for bottled cooking gas for the full year decreased to 5.4% from 5.8%, as the actual increase in this price in August was slightly lower than expected. However, the projections for the remainder of the year were not changed,
b. The projection for the readjustment of electricity tariffs decreased to 20.8% from 22.3%. The projection for the readjustment of telephone tariffs in 2003 increased 0.2p.p. to 25.7%. It should be noted that the dates for the readjustments were revised as a result of a judicial injunction against the readjustment of these tariffs according to the annual change of the IGP-DI. The Copom utilized the hypothesis that differences between the increases authorized by Anatel and the actual readjustment to date will be compensated in the remainder of the year,
c. The projected increase of 14.0% for regulated prices, which had a 28.6% weight in the August IPCA, was maintained,
d. For 2004, it is assumed that the readjustment of regulated prices will follow the endogenous determination model of regulated prices. Under this methodology, which considers the change in the exchange rate, free price inflation and the change in the IGPDI, as well as seasonal factors, the projection for the readjustment of regulated prices in 2004 was reduced by 0.6 p.p., to 8.3%,
e. The projection for the 6-month spread over the Selic rate, following the specification of the VAR model using the Selic and the swap rate on the eve of the Copom meeting, was –275 b.p. for the fourth quarter of 2003, gradually rising to 50 b.p. at the end of 2004.
10. Regarding fiscal policy, it is assumed that the primary surplus target of 4.25% of GDP for this year and the following two years will be accomplished. The other related assumptions established in the August meeting were maintained.
11. Considering the baseline scenario hypotheses, including the maintenance of the Selic interest rate at 22.0% p.a. and the exchange rate at the level prevailing on the eve of the Copom meeting (R$2.90), inflation is projected above the adjusted target of 8.5% for 2003 and below the target of 5.5% for 2004.
12. The behavior of inflation in August confirmed the positive results of June and July. The maintenance of exchange rate stability and inflation expectations in line with the trajectory of the inflation targets indicate that the cycle of readjustment of relative prices that the Brazilian economy had experienced since 2002 has reached its end.
13. August IPCA inflation reached 0.34%, in line with projections presented at the August Copom meeting. The increase of 0.14 p.p. compared to July was due to increases in regulated prices and seasonally-sensitive items. Among these prices, notable increases included the prices of meat, due to the inter-harvest period, and the price of domestic services, which was captured in the August IPCA for methodological reasons even though changes typically occur mainly in April and May. It is important to highlight that the proportion of items with positive readjustments in the monthly IPCA has been falling since March, and stood at 56.4% in August, the lowest figure since January 2001.
14. The behavior of core inflation signals a downward trend in inflation. Core IPCA inflation calculated under the trimmed-mean method with smoothing and excluding regulated prices fell for the fifth consecutive month, and core inflation calculated under the trimmed-mean method without smoothing fell in August, after relative stability in June and July. Core inflation excluding regulated prices and household food items increased 0.37%, the same increase observed in July. Other core inflation measures, such as the IPC-BR, also point out to a downward trend for inflation. 
15. After three consecutive months of deflation, wholesale prices increased in August, reflecting the beginning of an inter-harvest period and the end of the passthrough of the exchange rate appreciation that had been occurring since March. In August, the wholesale price index for agricultural products increased 1.8% while the wholesale index for industrial products rose 0.3%. Agricultural wholesale prices will continue to put upward pressure on retail prices in the next few months. As is typical at the end of the year, these increases are expected to reverse as the inter4 harvest period ends. However, the reversal may be partial, since there may be a change of price level for some items. This seems to be the case for soybean products, as soy prices increased recently in the international market. 
16. As a consequence of the inter-harvest period and expected readjustments for regulated prices, inflation is expected to increase slightly in the upcoming months. In the medium-run, however, the Copom judges that inflation will return to the moderate levels observed recently.
17. The economy has started to show signs of a recovery from the deceleration observed in the first half of the year. As is usual in the early stages of a recovery, indicators of economic activity are giving contradictory signals. Hours worked, industrial production and sales, and electricity consumption in São Paulo all increased in August compared to July (s.a. data). Retail sales and employment were stable in June and July, while installed capacity utilization, and purchase of capital goods and civil construction inputs decreased.
18. The Copom estimates that activity will be recovering from the second half of this year onward. The easing of monetary policy, inititiated in June and intensified in subsequent months, the increase in the supply of credit, and the increase in real incomes due to the decrease in inflation will allow consumption to increase progressively. Net exports, continue to provide support to aggregate demand, although at a lower relative magnitude. As a result of the level of idle capacity in the economy, a recovery of investment may take some months to occur. Generally speaking, even if investment recovers after consumption, the Copom maintains its judgement from the August meeting that the the recovery of the economy will be balanced, and will occur at a speed that keeps demand growth in line with the growth of aggregate supply.
19. To maintain price stability in a longer horizon, the growth of aggregate demand must continue to be compatible with increases in aggregate supply. The decrease of investment in recent years – sharpened in the second quarter of 2003 - has had a negative effect on the growth of productive capacity. On the other hand, the maintenance of monetary and fiscal policies consistent with macroeconomic equilibrium and the approval of reforms now in the Congress will have positive impacts on the growth of potential GDP. The Copom will monitor the evolution of aggregate demand, in order to ensure that the growth of installed capacity utilization does not outstrip the completion of new investments.
20. The external scenario improved significantly since the August Copom meeting. The Real was less volatile and appreciated moderately against the US dollar, with the exchange rate falling from a plateau of R$3.00 to a level around R$2.90. Country risk measured by the Embi+ fell from 730 b.p. to 650 b.p. The Brazilian external accounts continued to post positive results, with increasing surpluses in the trade balance due to export growth, enough to produce small surpluses in the current account. FDI recovered in July and August, and sovereign and private securities were placed in the international market between August and September. As a consequence of the stability of the real and the favorable behavior of the external accounts, there is no expectation of new inflationary pressures coming from the exchange rate.
21. The BCB’s inflation forecasts, assuming the maintenance of the Selic interest rate at 22.0% p.a. and the exchange rate at R$2.90/US$, point to inflation above the adjusted target of 8.5% for 2003. A small reduction of the projection for this year was due to the fall of market expectations for inflation, exchange rate appreciation and the 2Q2003 GDP released by IBGE, which was lower than expected and incorporated into the projections for the year. The trajectory of inflation remains compatible with the path presented in the Open Letter sent by the BCB Governor to the Ministry of Finance on January 21st, 2003.
22. The BCB’s inflation forecasts for the next 12 months and for 2004 were reduced slightly, due to the lower than expected GDP results and the 0.4 p.p. reduction in the projection for regulated price inflation in 2004. The new projections, assuming the maintenance of the Selic interest rate at 22.0% p.a. and the exchange rate at R$2.90/US$, remain below the trend of the inflation targets.
23. During the last few months, the convergence of inflation expectations to the trajectory of the inflation targets played a key role in generating positive inflation results. Monetary policy should guide the basic interest rate in order to ensure that expectations are consistent with the convergence of inflation to the targets. The median of market inflation expectations has been roughly stable since the August Copom meeting. For inflation in 2003, market expectations decreased to 9.6% from 9.7%. Regarding expectations for inflation in the next twelve months, there was a slight increase to 6.5% from 6.4%. For 2004, market expectations were stable at 6.2%. 24. The Copom evaluates the risks in the projections for the inflation trajectory on an ongoing basis.
Some of these risks have become less significant, such as the doubts regarding the degree of inertia after the inflationary peak in the last quarter of 2002. During the last quarter of the year, the Copom will be observing wage readjustments that will occur under collective bargaining agreements. It will be important to differentiate two types of readjustments: i) those in sectors with relative price gains since last year, notably the sector of tradables, which has benefited from the exchange rate depreciation, and ii) those based on past inflation, rather than its projected or current performance for the sector.
25. As the disinflation process continues, other risks become more important. With consecutive reductions in the over-Selic rate since June, the real interest rate has come closer to the mediumrun level consistent with sustainable growth and price stability. As the basic interest rate approaches this level, the greater the relative importance of risks associated with the uncertainties of the monetary policy transmission mechanism, including the lags and magnitudes of the impact of changes in the over-Selic rate on the inflation. With this progressive change in the relative importance of risks, gradualism in the conduct of monetary policy becomes increasingly important. 
26. With the projection of inflation for the next twelve months and for 2004 below the target, market expectations stable and consistent with the targeted path, and the exchange rate and external accounts not presenting a source of inflationary pressure in the short-run, the Copom believes it is appropriate to continue the process of monetary policy easing, and decided unanimously to fix the Over-Selic rate target at 20% p.a.
"
31/10/2003;89;Henrique Meirelles;"1. The main price indices showed higher rates of inflation in September, reflecting pressures on food prices, mainly caused by the effects of the inter-harvest period, and readjustments in regulated prices.
2. The IPCA rose by 0.78% in September, after an increase of 0.34% in the previous month, accumulating increases of 8.05% and 15.14% in 2003 and in 12 months, respectively. The IGP-DI rose by 1.05% in September, after an increase of 0.62% in August, driven by an increase of 1.29% in the IPA-DI and 0.76% in the IPC-Br.
3. Regarding the IPCA, the increase of 1.44% in regulated prices contributed 0.41 p.p. to the overall result of the index, while the 0.51% increase in free prices contributed the remaining 0.37 p.p. Among regulated prices, notable increases included water and sewage tariffs, fixed telephone and electricity tariffs, and the price of auto fuel. With respect to free prices, the most significant impact came from the reversal in the behavior of food prices, with a 0.78% increase in September, after a decline of 0.27% in August. This reversal was due to the effects of the inter-harvest period, which caused increases in cattle and poultry prices. The notable performance of exports of these products in 2003 has contributed to sustain price increases. Still considering food products, the evolution of perishable food prices is also worth mentioning, as they remained stable in September (-0.07%), after accumulating a decrease of 16.5% in the June-August quarter.
4. Both agricultural and industrial wholesale prices registered higher rates of inflation in September. The agricultural IPA rose 3.55%, compared to a 1.77% increase in August, as a result of the price increases of meat (cattle, pork and poultry) and corn, due to the inter-harvest period, and soy, because of the evolution of international market prices. Industrial prices increased 0.40%, after a 0.29% increase in August, pressed by food products (mainly meat, fish and vegetable oil), agricultural machines and mining products.
5. Core IPCA inflation calculated by excluding household food items and regulated prices increased 0.37% in September, repeating the increase registered in the previous month. The accumulated change in the last twelve months stood at 10.54%.
6. Core IPCA inflation calculated under the trimmed-mean method (smoothed) increased 0.86% in September, compared to 0.58% in August. In the last twelve months, the accumulated change stood at 12.68%, still reflecting the effects of price increases at the end of 2002. Inflation calculated without the smoothing procedure for pre-selected items reached 0.60% and 11.51% in the month and in twelve months, respectively.
7. Core IPC-Br inflation calculated under the symmetric trimmed-mean method by Fundação Getúlio Vargas (FGV) rose to 0.67% in September, accumulating an increase of 12.43% in the twelve months ending in September.
8. In October, both consumer and wholesale price indices should register lower increases. In the wholesale index, a decrease in agricultural prices is expected, which has already been detected in the partial IGP-M results released by FGV. In the consumer index, the price deceleration will result mainly from lower readjustments of regulated items. Concerning free prices, pressures on food prices and clothing prices will likely persist, the former as a consequence of the inter-harvest period, and the latter due to seasonal factors.
9. The identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available information. The scenario considered in the simulations assumes the following hypotheses:
a. The projection for the readjustment of gasoline prices in the remainder of 2003 was revised. The new projection for this year’s readjustment stands at 1.3%, 0.9 p.p. lower than the projection in the September Copom meeting. The projections for bottled cooking gas for the full year decreased to 5.3% from 5.4%,
b. The projection for the readjustment of electricity tariffs increased slightly to 21.2%, from 20.8% in the September meeting. On the other hand, the projection for the readjustment of telephone tariffs in 2003 was reduced by 0.2 p.p., going back to the 25.5% that had been projected in the July and August meetings,
c. The projection for regulated price inflation in 2003 (which had a 28.75% weight in the September IPCA), decreased by 0.1 p.p., to 13.9%, as a consequence of a fall in the projected readjustment for gasoline and fuel alcohol,
d. For regulated prices in 2004, the Copom started to work with specific projections for each item, substituting for the endogenous determination model used in the previous meetings. The new procedure is justified because, as 2004 approaches, it becomes possible to obtain more precise information about the readjustment of specific items for next year, notably for those items whose price readjustments are decided at the sub-national levels. Under this new methodology, the projection for regulated price inflation in 2004 rose by 0.6 p.p., reaching 8.9% in October, 
e. The projection for the 6-month spread over the Selic rate, following the specification of the VAR model using the Selic and the swap rates on the eve of the Copom meeting, was - 190 b.p. for the fourth quarter of 2003, gradually rising to 85 b.p. at the end of 2004.
10. Regarding fiscal policy, it is assumed that the primary surplus target of 4.25% of the GDP for this year and the following two years will be accomplished. The other related assumptions established in the September meeting were maintained.
11. Considering the baseline scenario hypotheses, including the maintenance of the Selic interest rate at 20.0% p.a. and the exchange rate at the level prevailing on the eve of the Copom meeting (R$2.85), inflation is projected above the adjusted target of 8.5% for 2003 and below the target of 5.5% for 2004.
12. September inflation measured by the IPCA was 0.78%, 0.44 p.p. above August inflation. The higher inflation in September was observed in all components of the IPCA: non-tradable goods, tradable goods and regulated prices, especially in the latter two categories. Inflation measured by other consumer price indices like the IPC-Fipe, the IPC-Br and the INPC also registered increases from August to September, as did inflation measured by the IGPs and IPAs. Regarding the IPAs, it is important to highlight the increase in inflation in the agricultural IPA to 3.6% in September, from 1.8% in August, mainly due to a stronger impact of the inter-harvest period and increases in the prices of some internationally traded commodities.
13. All core inflation measures also increased, except for the one calculated excluding regulated prices and household food items, which remained stable at 0.37% for the third consecutive month. After decreasing for 5 consecutive months, from August to September core inflation calculated under the trimmed-mean method with smoothing increased to 0.86%, from 0.58%, compared to an increase to 0.60% from 0.35% in core inflation calculated under the method without smoothing. Combining the smoothed trimmed-mean core of the IPCA with the corresponding core of the IPCA-15, a gradual elevation since August is evident and, with the October change in the IPCA-15, the series registered the fourth consecutive fortnightly increase. The performance of core IPC-Br inflation was similar, increasing in September after four consecutive months of decline. Finally, the ratio of IPCA items that had positive changes also rose, to 63.5%% in September from 56.4% in August, surpassing the proportion observed in the three previous months.
14. The Copom maintains the diagnosis presented in previous Minutes that the increase of inflation in September was temporary, explained by the inter-harvest period, by the increase of international prices of some commodities, such as soy, and by the readjustment of regulated prices. Considering that the inter-harvest effects have not yet ended, some pressures on inflation may continue in the short run. However, the Copom will continue to act in order to consolidate the current gains against inflation. For that purpose, in the coming months it will follow the evolution of inflation and of the different measures of core inflation, distinguishing between specific readjustments and persistent or generalized price increases.
15. The economic activity indicators released since the September meeting confirm the recovery scenario that the Copom was assuming in recent months. According to the IBGE, industrial production rose 1.5% between July and August (seasonally adjusted). This increase was broadbased, with a higher number of industrial sectors reversing the trend of declining production, which prevailed in the first half of the year. Other indicators also point to a recovery of production, including industrial sales, which according to the CNI increased 5% between July and August, and the consumption of energy, which rose 0.8% in the same period and 1.6% in September. The industrial business confidence index, released quarterly by the FGV, also increased in October, compared to July, and reached a level of 56, above the reference value of 50, indicating better future prospects.
16. The recovery of industrial production should be confirmed in the coming months, due to favorable prospects for real sales in the retail sector. Among the factors supporting this forecast are low banking delinquency rates, the increase in real wages and a likely increase in lending to businesses and consumers – in the latter case, with an additional impulse from recently created mechanisms for discounts of loan repayment installments from payrolls, which should allow not only an increase in credit, but also a decline in interest rates. In spite of the fact that real wages are still below the levels prevailing at the end of 2002, they have been gradually recovering in recent months. With the prospect of inflation stabilizing in line with the trajectory of the inflation targets, real earnings will tend to increase. Furthermore, despite the fact that the unemployment rate remains at around 13%, due to the continuous increase in the economically active population, total employment has increased in recent months. The slower recovery of consumption, in comparison to production, reinforces the perception that the recovery of economic activity will continue to be well-balanced, and it is important to note that installed capacity utilization remains low.
17. The external accounts maintained the positive performance observed so far this year. In September, the trade surplus reached US$ 2.7 billion, very close to the peak value registered in August. The trade balance accumulated up to September is US$ 17.8 billion, more than twice the result registered in the same period of 2002, and is due more to the increase of exports (21.3% in comparison to the same period of the previous year), than to the decline of imports (1.8%). It is important to highlight that the increase of exports in this period was mainly due to growth of export volumes, although it was also favored by higher export prices. Finally, the growth of exports was also explained by market diversification, including to China, and the recovery of traditional trade partners, as in the case of Argentina. As a consequence of the higher trade surpluses, the current account balance now shows a surplus in the year.
18. Since the September Copom meeting, there was a decrease in the volatility of the foreign exchange rate, which has appreciated moderately against the US dollar from a plateau of R$2.90 to a level around R$ 2.85. In this period country risk measured by the Embi+ fell from 650 b.p. to 607 b.p.. In addition, the Republic issued US$1.5 billion in bonds at a lower rate than in previous issues. Considering the current scenario the Copom believes that the external scenario in the coming months will remain significantly more favorable for the Brazilian economy than in recent years. This is true even if there is a deceleration in the speed of recovery of the advanced economies or a deterioration in international liquidity or risk appetite.
19. The reduction of country risk, the stability of the exchange rate and the good performance of the external accounts are a result of the consistent macroeconomic policy and the favorable international scenario, which is characterized by improved prospects for growth in the US and Asia and by the increase of global liquidity. The progress of domestic structural reforms, which will improve the flexibility of the economy and the composition of public expenditure and revenues, will bring medium-term benefits for monetary policy, help decreasing risk premiums and strengthen the capacity of the Brazilian economy to withstand shocks.
20. After the relative stability between August and September, the median of market inflation expectations for next year has decreased in October. For the next 12 months, market expectations decreased to 6.25% from 6.50%, which is in accordance with the trajectory of the inflation targets up to September. For 2004, market expectations decreased to 6.0% from 6.2%. These results show that monetary policy has been able to coordinate market expectations so that they converge to the trajectory of the inflation targets and suggest that economic agents consider the increase of inflation in September as a one-off event. Nonetheless, market inflation expectations increased for 2003 to 9.8% from 9.6%, which reflects the fact that September inflation was higher than projected.
21. The BCB´s inflation forecasts, assuming the maintenance of the Selic rate at 20% p.a. and the exchange rate at R$ 2.85, still point to inflation above the adjusted target of 8.5% for 2003. Using the same assumptions for the exchange and interest rates, the BCB´s forecasts for the next 12 months and 2004 are below the targets. The forecasts for 2004 are slightly higher than the September meeting projections mainly due to the impact of the higher projections for the readjustments of regulated prices next year. Even with the increase of the inflation forecasts, the inflation trajectory for the coming months remains below the path presented in the Open Letter sent by the BCB Governor to the Ministry of Finance on January 21st, 2003.
22. In the Minutes of its September meeting, the Copom analyzed the risks of wage readjustments under collective bargaining agreements to the trajectory of inflation. The readjustments so far have been below the level of 12-month accumulated inflation but higher than projected inflation for the next 12 months. As a consequence, it appears that a moderate increase of real wages, compatible with the recovery of the economic activity without a generalized process of re-indexation, is set to materialize.
23. The Copom forecasts inflation based on models which, by their nature and limitations, have some uncertainties about the magnitude and lag of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. The main impacts of the reductions in the Selic rate in the third quarter of this year on economic activity are still beginning to materialize. The recovery of economic activity that has been observed since the third quarter is mainly due to improvements in the risk profile of the Brazilian economy and the effects of monetary policy on the yield curve in previous quarters. For this reason, the Copom will be carefully following the recovery of economic activity so as to keep it balanced and to avoid inflation pressures. This monitoring is important as a consequence of the changes in the real interest rate in recent months. However, with the progressive consolidation of the favorable prospects recently observed for medium-term inflation, the Copom considers that there is room for additional cuts in the Selic rate in the future.
24. Since forecasts for 12 month ahead and 2004 inflation remain below the target, market expectations continue to converge to the trajectory of the targets, and the favorable external scenario contributes to price stability, the Copom decided to fix the Selic rate target at 19.0% p.a., continuing the process of monetary policy easing.

28/11/2003;90;Henrique Meirelles;"1. The main price indices showed lower changes in October, confirming the evaluation that the increase registered in September was temporary. Besides, the results for October revealed that the main contributions to the monthly inflation were localized, ratifying the downward trend for various core measures of consumer price inflation.
2. The IPCA rose 0.29% in October, compared to 0.78% in the previous month, accumulating an increase of 8.37% in the year, and of 13.98% in twelve months. The IGP-DI rose 0.44%, after an increase of 1.05% in September, influenced by a 0.50% increase in the IPA-DI, and a 0.21% increase in the IPC-Br. The IGP-DI and the IPA-DI indices accumulated in twelve months were reduced for the 7th consecutive month in October, reaching 15.78% and 16.36%, respectively.
3. Regarding the IPCA, the 0.38% increase in free prices contributed with 0.27 p.p. to the overall result of the index, while the 0.07% increase in regulated prices contributed with the remaining 0.02 p.p.. In the first group, the increases were concentrated in specific items, of which chicken price alone, with a 11.4% increase in the month, contributed with 0.1 p.p. in the overall result for October. Most part of the food prices, however, showed deceleration in October, jointly registering a 0.45% variation, compared to 0.78% in September.
4. Concerning regulated prices, a 1% increase in electricity tariffs was observed, due to the increase of the so-called “emergency capacity fee” and the tariffs readjustment in the city of Goiânia. On the other hand, the fall in fuel prices, as well as in airplane ticket prices, explain the stability of overall regulated prices in the month, after expressive increases observed from July to September.
5. In the wholesale sector, both agricultural and industrial prices registered smaller variations in October, compared to the previous month. The Agricultural-IPA rose 1.30%, after an increase of 3.55% in September, still reflecting the increase of soy prices in the international market, and pressures in meat prices, albeit in lower magnitude than in the previous month. Industrial prices increased 0.18% in the month, after a 0.40% increase in September. The deceleration of industrial prices was determined mainly by the decrease in prices of motor fuel, fertilizers, pharmaceutical products, iron, steel and by-products.
6. Core IPCA inflation calculated excluding household food items and regulated prices increased 0.37% for the fourth consecutive month, accumulating a 10.14% increase in the last twelve months. 
7. Core IPCA inflation calculated under the smoothed trimmed-mean method increased 0.77% in October, compared to 0.86% in September. In the last twelve months, the accumulated change stood at 12.67%, still reflecting the effects of price increases in the end of 2002. Inflation calculated without the smoothing procedure for pre-selected items reached 0.29% and 10.87% in the month and in twelve months, respectively.
8. Core IPC-Br inflation calculated under the symmetric trimmed-mean method by FGV rose 0.5% in October, accumulating an increase of 11.91% in the twelve months ending in October. 
9. In November, both consumer and wholesale price indices should register variations close to those observed in October. In the wholesale index, increases in the prices of vegetables, fruit, fertilizers and mechanic industry goods are expected, whereas decreases are expected in the prices of eggs, beans, corn and sugar. The relative stability expected for the IPCA variation will result from the continuity of deceleration of free prices, particularly food prices, and increases in regulated prices. The price increase expected for this group comes from the price readjustments for lotteries, urban bus services in Rio de Janeiro, and electricity tariffs in the concession areas of Light and Companhia Estadual de Energia Elétrica (CEEE), whose impacts should more than compensate price decreases that have been observed in motor fuel.
10. The identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available information. The scenario considered in the simulations assumes the following hypotheses:
a. There has been a 0.5% reduction in the projections for the readjustment of gasoline in 2003. The new projection for this year’s readjustment stands at 0.8% for the whole year. Regarding bottled gas, projections have also been reduced, and, for 2003, a 4.6% readjustment is expected,
b. In relation to household electricity tariffs, the readjustment projection slightly increased from the last Copom meeting, to 21.7% in November, from 21.2% in October. Projections for fixed telephone fees readjustments in 2003 were reduced significantly in November, falling from 25% to 19.1%, value that has already been accumulated in the year up to October. Therefore, projections for 2003 assume that no new judicial decision will be made until the end of the year allowing fixed telephone companies to readjust tariffs,
c. For all regulated prices, with a total weight of 28.9% in the IPCA of October, inflation projected for 2003 fell 0.6% p.p., posting 13.3%, mainly due to the fall in the projections for price readjustments of gasoline and bottled gas, despite the slight exchange rate depreciation that took place in the last month,
d. The regulated prices projections in 2004, based on specific projections for each item, decreased 0.4 p.p., to 8.5% in November, mainly as a consequence of a fall in the projected readjustment for public transportation for 2004,
e. The projection for the 6-month spread over the Selic rate, following the specification of the VAR model using the Selic and the swap rates on the eve of the Copom meeting, was –130 b.p. for the fourth quarter of 2003, gradually rising to 70 b.p. at the end of 2004.
11. Regarding fiscal policy, it is assumed that the primary surplus target of 4.25% of the GDP for this year and the following two years will be accomplished. The other related assumptions established in the October meeting were maintained.
12. Considering the baseline scenario hypotheses, including the maintenance of the Selic interest rate at 19.0% p.a. and the exchange rate at the level prevailing on the eve of the Copom meeting (R$2.95), inflation is projected above the adjusted target of 8.5% for 2003 and below the target of 5.5% for 2004.
13. The inflation decrease in October confirms the Copom’s evaluation expressed in the minutes of the previous month’s meeting that the acceleration of inflation in September was temporary. Regarding the IPCA, the 0.29% inflation in October was almost 0.5 p.p. lower than the result of September. 
This reduction was generalized, having been verified in regulated prices and in both components of free prices: tradable and non-tradable items. Other consumer price indices, as the IPC-Fipe and the IPC-Br, also showed lower inflation in October. Preliminary data for November, as the IPCA-15, IPC-Fipe and the weekly IPC of FGV, suggest that inflation for November tends to fall or stabilize at levels around the one observed in October. The behavior of the general and wholesale price indices was similar. It is worth mentioning that the agricultural IPA, with a variation of 1.30%, a 2.3 p.p. decrease in comparison to September, shows the reduction of the “inter-harvest” effects over inflation. It is increasingly likely that a one-digit inflation for the IPCA will be accomplished in 2003, which has already been anticipated by market participants since August according to the surveys carried weekly by the Investor Relations Group (Gerin).
14. All core inflation measures had the same behavior of the inflation indices. Core inflation measures calculated under the trimmed-mean method, either smoothed or not, fell. Core IPCA inflation calculated by excluding household food items and regulated prices remained stable at 0.37% for the fourth consecutive month. The ratio of IPCA items that had positive variations fell to 61.1% in October from 63.4% in September, below the 63.5% mean observed since the beginning of the floating exchange rate regime.
15. Economic activity indicators released since the October meeting confirm the recovery scenario that the Copom was outlining in recent months. According to IBGE, industrial production rose 7.0% since June (s.a.). In September industrial production rose 4.3%, reaching a level higher than in the same month in 2002, what had not occurred since May 2003. Following the trend outlined since August, industrial production growth was more spread, with expansion reaching 17 of 20 sectors and all the category of uses. The recovery of industrial activity evidenced in the IBGE indicators is confirmed by the CNI seasonally adjusted data, which shows an increase in working hours and in the installed capacity between August and September. The Copom evaluates that the recovery in the economy should strengthen in the next months, even though a decrease in the growth rates occur compared to the high rates observed in September 
16. The scenario of recovery in consumption is now more clearly outlined, although at a slower pace than output. According to IBGE, the volume of retail sales in 2003 is lower than the level for the same months of 2002. However, the decreases are gradually falling, reaching 2.7% in September from 5.9% in August. Compared to June, seasonally adjusted data show an accumulated growth of 0.9% that should be interpreted with caution due to the reduced size of the series. Preliminary sales figures in the greater São Paulo, according to Fecomércio, show a 0.5% s.a. increase in October, compared to September. Another evidence of the recovery in consumption is the increase of consultations to the Credit Protection System (SPC) and Usecheque in October.
17. The Copom foresees a consolidation of the consumption upward trend over the next months due to better credit conditions and progressive recovery in real income due to wage agreements and other developments in the labor market. The new scheme of repaying loans directly from payrolls should continue to allow the expansion of credit concessions at significantly lower costs. Besides, according to CNI and Fiesp, real wages in the manufacturing sector are expanding since the beginning of the year. According to the CNI, wage payroll in September is very close to the observed at the end of the third quarter of 2002. In September there was an increase of both total number of employed workers (1.2%, according to the IBGE) and formally employed workers (0.5%, according to the Ministry of Labor). However, the unemployment rate calculated by IBGE in September is practically unaltered at 12.9% due to continued increase in the labor force. The lag between improvement in activity and fall in jobless rate is usual in cyclical recoveries, as the number of workers entering the labor force increases more than job positions. In the short run, consumption shall be supported by the end-of-year bonus (13th wage) in an environment of more favorable expectations regarding the economy.
18. Another important result for the consolidation of a improving economic activity scenario is the evidence that investment also begins to recover. In September there was an increase of 11.4% in absorption of capital goods compared to August (s.a.), which corresponds to the sum of production and net exports of capital goods, a good indicator of the investment in the economy. So, the increase in investment reinforces the Copom evaluation presented in previous minutes in the sense that economic growth will be balanced without inflationary pressure, using excess of idle capacity in the beginning followed by an increase in installed capacity.
19. External accounts sustained the positive performance observed so far this year. The excellent results from October and the first weeks of November rose the Central Bank’s trade balance forecast to US$23.5 billion from US$20.5 billion. The current account projection to 2003 increased in this period to US$3 billion surplus from a US$1.2 billion deficit. The country risk measured by the Embi+ fell 25 b.p. since last Copom meeting reaching 583 b.p. The foreign exchange rate has depreciated against the US dollar from R$2.85 to R$2.95.
20. In the last months the probability of a scenario of jointly growth of the world economy has increased, with good perspectives in the US, Europe and Japan. The perspectives of growth in the developing economies are the most favorable in recent years. The growth of world economy will boost international liquidity and increase demand for Brazilian exports. As a consequence, Brazilian economy may recover without more significant pressures over the Balance of Payments financing or the exchange rate.
21. The medians of the market inflation expectations sustained the downward trend. For 2003, probably as a result of the lower-than-expected October inflation, expectations decreased to 9.4% from 9.8%. For the next 12 months, market expectations decreased to 5.9% from 6.25%, which is lower than the 6.0% stipulated by the trajectory of the inflation targets for October 2004. For 2004, expectations remained at 6.0%. This evolution in inflation expectations occurred together with an increase in GDP expectations to 3.4% from 3.2%. Economic agents seem to anticipate a balanced recovery, without threatening the inflation target set up for 2004.
22. The Central Bank’s inflation forecasts, assuming the maintenance of the Selic rate at 19% p.a. and the exchange rate at R$2.95, still point to an inflation above the adjusted target of 8.5% for 2003. Under the same assumptions for the exchange and interest rate, the Central Bank’s forecasts for the next 12 months and 2004 are below the targets. The forecasts have not changed significantly since October because the inflationary impact of the exchange rate depreciation was compensated by the lower-than-projected inflation in October and the decrease to 8.5% from 8.9% of expected regulated prices growth for 2004. Thus, inflation trajectory for the coming months remains below the path presented in the Open Letter sent by the Central Bank’s Governor to the Ministry of Finance on January 21st, 2003.
23. The Copom understood consensually that it was necessary to carry on with monetary easing, considering that the inflation projections associated to the baseline scenario for the next twelve months and for 2004 remained below the inflation target, that inflation expectations were compatible with the path of the target and with the balanced recovery of the economy, and that the external scenario is favorable to price stability. It was also consensual in the Copom that the direct and indirect effects of successive reductions of the Over-Selic rate target since June did not yet materialize totally in the behavior of activity and inflation. These reductions, which accumulated 750 b.p. between June and October, were accompanied by the sustained reduction of market real interest rates for different maturities. As highlighted in previous meetings, there are important uncertainties regarding the magnitude and the lag of monetary transmission.
24. Two members of the Copom considered more adequate, at this moment, to reduce the Over-Selic rate target by 100 b.p., continuing the monetary easing at a slower pace, and adjourning more expansionist moves when economic growth consolidates whilst inflation is consistent with the targets. However, most of the Copom members understood that the risk balance for activity level and inflation already justified a complementary expansionist impulse, through the reduction of 150 b.p. in the Over-Selic rate target, not ignoring the uncertainties regarding the monetary transmission.
"
24/12/2003;91;Henrique Meirelles;"1. The main inflation indicators remained stable in November, compared to October, presenting low rates and low dispersion. This behavior confirms the favorable recent inflationary outlook, in which the main disturbing factors are seasonal and temporary. 
2. The IPCA increased 0.34% in November compared to 0.29% in the previous month, totaling 8.74% in the year and 11.02% in the last twelve months. The IGP-DI changed 0.48%, after an increase of 0.44% in October, influenced by the IPA-DI and the IPC-Br increases (0.46% and 0.33%, respectively). The IGP-DI and IPA-DI changes accumulated in twelve months to November decreased for the eighth consecutive month, to 9.92% and 8.79%, respectively. 
3. Regarding the IPCA, lotteries and urban bus fares in Rio de Janeiro were the main individual contributors to the November result (contributing 0.06 p.p. and 0.05 p.p., respectively). Clothing, under seasonal factors influence, presented an average increase of 0.99% in November, compared to 0.92% in October, contributing 0.05 p.p. to the IPCA result. Food prices increased 0.25%, compared to 0.46% in the previous month, mainly due to the deceleration of meat and chicken prices increase. 
4. Still regarding the IPCA in November, market prices changed 0.33% and regulated prices increased 0.36%, contributing 0.24 p.p. and 0.10 p.p. to the overall result, respectively. In the first group, the increases were concentrated in clothing, meat and chicken prices. Regarding regulated prices, besides lottery and urban bus fares in Rio de Janeiro, electricity tariffs were increased in Rio de Janeiro, Porto Alegre and Goiânia. On the other hand, gasoline, fuel-alcohol and bottled gas prices decreased during the month. 
5. The IPA-DI reached 0.46% compared to 0.50% in October, with divergent behaviors for agricultural and industrial prices. The Agricultural-IPA decelerated 0.26%, after an increase of 1.30% in the previous month, due to lower increase in soybean prices and drop in prices of milk, eggs and pork. On the contrary, rice prices increased. 
6. On the other hand, wholesale industrial prices presented a slight acceleration, increasing 0.54% in November compared to 0.18% in October. This acceleration was caused by chemical prices, especially oil and lubricating products, paint products, and fertilizers and pesticides. Also important were the increases in prices of cotton fabrics, reflecting the increase in the raw material, and of steel. 
7. The IPCA core inflation, excluding food and regulated prices, remained stable in November for the fifth consecutive month, at 0.38%. In the last 12 months, the core accumulates a 9.28% change. 
8. Core IPCA inflation calculated under the smoothed trimmed-mean method reached 0.56% in November compared to 0.77% in October. The accumulated variation in 12 months reached 11.82%, still affected by the inflation upsurge at the end of 2002. The non-smoothed trimmed-mean core stood at 0.31% in November and 9.36% in 12 months. 
9. Core IPC-Br inflation calculated under the symmetric trimmed-mean method by FGV reached 0.36% in November, accumulating an increase of 10.69% in the last twelve months. 
10. In December, both consumer and wholesale inflation are likely to register changes close to November. At the wholesale level, some pressure is expected in prices of vegetables, fruit, rice and corn, while prices of milk, eggs, soybeans and sugar cane are expected to fall. For the IPCA, the December result will be affected by rises in regulated prices (lotteries and urban bus fares in Belém and Fortaleza), as well as a slight acceleration in food prices. 
11. The identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available information. The scenario considered in the simulations assumes the following hypotheses: 
a. Gasoline and bottled cooking gas prices are projected to accumulate increases of 0.9% and 3.7%, in 2003, respectively. For 2004, the changes in gasoline and bottled cooking gas prices are projected to reach 9.5% and 3.5%, respectively. The readjustment of gasoline prices encompasses an increase in the CIDE rate to partially compensate the federal government for sharing this tax with states and municipalities, as part of the recently enacted tax reform, 
b. The projection for the readjustment of household electricity tariffs in 2003 decreased 0.1 p.p., reaching 21.6%. For 2004, the readjustment is expected to be 7.2%. Concerning telephone tariffs, there was no change in the projection for 2003 since the last Copom meeting. For 2004, Copom estimates an increase of 6.6%, assuming that the judicial injunction which limited the readjustment of the tariffs authorized for 2003 will not be reverted, 
c. For the inflation of regulated prices in 2004, which weighted 28.9% in the November IPCA, the BCB projection decreased 0.7 p.p., reaching 7.8%, 
d. The projection for the readjustment of regulated prices for 2005 was based on the model of endogenous determination that was used until the September Copom meeting to estimate 2004 readjustments. This model, which considers seasonal components, the exchange rate behavior, market prices inflation rate and the IGP-DI variation, forecasts a 5.5% change for regulated prices in 2005, 
e. The projection for the 6-month spread over the Selic rate, following the specification of the Vector Autoregressive model using the Selic and swap rates on the eve of the Copom meeting was –70 b.p. for the fourth quarter of 2003, gradually rising to 20 b.p. in the last quarter of 2004 and 50 b.p. at the end of 2005. 
12. Regarding fiscal policy, it is assumed that the primary surplus target of 4.25% of the GDP for this year and the following two years will be accomplished. The other related assumptions established in the November meeting were maintained. 
13. Considering the baseline scenario hypotheses, including the maintenance of the Selic interest rate at 17.5% p.a. and the exchange rate at the level prevailing on the eve of the Copom meeting (R$2.94), inflation is projected above the adjusted target of 8.5% for 2003 and below the target of 5.5% for 2004. 
14. November inflation results confirmed the convergence of inflation to the target path. Regarding the IPCA, the 0.34% inflation in November was just 0.05 p.p. higher than October. When the IPCA change is decomposed into three groups – regulated, tradable and non-tradable prices – low price dispersion is noticed in November, with changes for the three groups between 0.25% and 0.44%. Perishable food prices grew 0.5% due to weather factors, after two consecutive months of falling prices. This behavior is likely to repeat in the first quarter of 2004, without causing a generalized disturbance on market prices. Other consumer inflation indicators, such as the IPC-Fipe and the IPC-Br, also showed inflation around 0.3% in November. 
15. Core inflation measures also posted positive results, falling or remaining stable in moderate levels (from 0.3% to 0.4%) for the different methodologies – exclusion, smoothed trimmed mean and non-smoothed trimmed mean. The IPC-Br core also fell in November, reaching 0.36%. 
16. Considering accumulated inflation for the year until November and market inflation expectations for December, the IPCA change in 2003 may be slightly above 9%. This rate is close to the 8.5% adjusted inflation target and almost 3.5 p.p. lower than the 2002 inflation rate. This result confirms the monetary policy effectiveness in curbing the extremely negative outlook in the beginning of the year. 
17. Recent indicators provide additional evidence of the rebound in economic activity already outlined in previous Copom’s meetings. Industrial output maintains the upward trend. Seasonally adjusted results for October showed growth or stability for all categories of use, although total industrial output fell 0.5%. This apparently contradictory result is explained by the seasonal adjustment methodology. The 3-month moving average for October is 1.8% higher than the September average. Leading indicators suggest the continuation of the upward trend for November. The recovery has spread among different industrial sectors, and the diffusion index reached 79% (64% in September) in a scale where 100% indicates that all the 61 sub-sectors surveyed by the IBGE posted positive growth. 
18. Consumption recovery is becoming clearer, despite its slower growth compared to production growth. The IBGE retail survey shows an unambiguous marginal improvement, although the accumulated performance for the year is still being affected by the results in the first half of this year. Year-on-year accumulated sales are still negative, but its fall diminished to 5.0% in October from 5.2% in September. Furniture and appliances remain leading the retail segment, with positive performance for the second consecutive month (a 5.2% growth in comparison to October 2002). The assessment of the 3-month moving average of seasonally adjusted primary data of IBGE proves the gradual recovery of retail sales. Another evidence of consumption recovery is the increase in consultations to the Credit Protection System and Usecheque in October. Due to the improvement in credit conditions of the economy, durable goods are leading the recovery, which is expected to strengthen in view of the improvement in consumers’ confidence, the gradual recovery in real earnings and low delinquency indicators. 
19. Investment data surprised positively. Capital goods domestic absorption increased 22% in October compared to September. Considering this result, investment rate, although still at a historically low level, confirmed the rebound trend already outlined in the third quarter GDP data. Investment increase reinforces the Copom’s expectation of a well-balanced growth recovery, based on expansion in credit to consumers, increase in real earnings and expansion of productive capacity in the tradable goods sector, which idle capacity presents low levels due to exports growth. 
20. As in previous months, the external accounts performance remained positive. In the fourth quarter, daily exports grew 20% on average, compared to the same period of 2002, while imports increased 17% in the same period. The trade surplus may be close to US$ 24 billion in 2003, far above previous estimates. The positive performance should repeat in 2004, when a US$ 19 billion surplus is expected, despite the significant imports growth caused by the recovery of economic activity. The current account is expected to post a US$ 4 billion surplus this year, the first positive result since 1992. The country-risk has continued to fall since the last Copom meeting to close to 480 basis points, together with the drop in several international risk aversion indicators. The exchange rate remained roughly stable between the last Copom meetings. 
21. There was no alteration in the recovery external scenario assessed in the November meeting. The Copom shares the concerns of several international observers that a monetary tightening cycle may initiate in mid-2004 in the United States. However, considering the recent behavior of US inflation and productivity growth, it is not likely that an increase in US interest rates aborts the global recovery process and drastically reduces international liquidity. The Copom also fears that the widespread improvement of emerging markets risk perception may be reverted in case some countries suffer more intensively the effects of the worsening of the international scenario in 2004. Even so, Brazil is in better conditions than in previous years to face these situations, due to the significant improvement of its fundamentals and the government decision to extend the IMF agreement. 
22. The median of market inflation expectations for 2004 stabilized at 6%. As the mode and the median of market inflation expectations are equal, marginal variations only affect the mean, which fell below 6% for the first time in the year between the November and December Copom’s meetings. On the eve of the December meeting, the mean stood at 5.88%. The median of market expectations for GDP growth in 2004 increased to 3.5% from 3.4%. 
23. Inflation projections by the BCB for 2003 are above the adjusted target of 8.5%, assuming the maintenance of the Over-Selic rate at 17.5% p.a. and of the exchange rate at R$2.94. Considering the same hypotheses for the exchange rate and for the Over-Selic rate, inflation projections are below the target for 2004 and 2005. In comparison to November estimates, there was a slight reduction in inflation projected for 2004, due to the reduction to 7.8% from 8.5% in regulated prices. 
24. The positive trend of inflation, the well-balanced recovery of economic activity and the favorable external scenario led the Copom’s members to endorse the monetary easing. The Copom unanimously decided to reduce the target for the Over-Selic rate to 16.5% p.a., without bias. 
25. However, it is important to emphasize once again that there are important lags between monetary decisions and its effects on economic activity and inflation. Since the beginning of the ease cycle, the Over-Selic rate has been reduced by 10 p.p. Part of the effects of this cut has not materialized on the activity level yet. Nor has the recent recovery of activity shown its effects on inflation. 
26. The Copom evaluates that the reduction in the real yield curve, which accompanied the reduction of the Over-Selic rate, will sustain the recovery in economic activity in the coming months. The continuous convergence of inflation to the targets and the resulting consolidation of a long-lasting scenario of macroeconomic stability will contribute to a progressive reduction of risk perception. This environment will naturally create the conditions required for a lower real interest rate in the coming years. 
27. Considering the uncertainties in the transmission mechanism of monetary policy, the Copom understands that the sustainability of the disinflation gains in recent months and of the economic recovery process requires a careful assessment in future monetary decisions. In particular, monetary policy should not endorse the inflationary impact of the readjustment of prices in those sectors that now lead the recovery process. This is the only way to ensure the continuous convergence of inflation to the target path, in an environment of sustained economic growth.

30/01/2004;92;Henrique Meirelles;"1. The Broad Consumer Price Index (IPCA) rose 0.52% in December against a 0.34% rise in November and a 0.29% increase in October. As a consequence, inflation accumulated 9.30% in the year, substantially lower than the projections made at the beginning of 2003, which pointed to consumer prices growth of around 12% for the year. The IGP-DI rose 0.60% in December, after a 0.48% increase in November, influenced by the 0.74% and the 0.43% variations of the IPA-DI and IPC-Br, respectively. Accumulated changes of the IGP-DI and the IPA-DI in 2003 totaled 7.67% and 6.26%, respectively, remarkably lower than the 2002 results of 26.41% and 35.41%, in the same order. 
2. The more important individual contributions for the IPCA rise in December came from tobacco, clothing, rice and meat, and the readjustment of regulated prices such as urban bus tariffs, which altogether accounted for 0.23 p.p. of the total change of the index. Conversely, price falls of chicken, milk, beans and bottled gas contributed with -0.07 p.p. for the IPCA monthly variation. For the 9.30% variation in 2003, regulated and market prices contributed with 3.76 p.p. and 5.54 p.p., respectively. Among the latter, price pressures were substantial in some oligopolized sectors, as in the cases of personal hygiene products (12.2%), cleansing products (13.9%), furniture (11.8%) and medicine (11.5%). Rice prices, under unfavorable supply conditions since the beginning of the year, rose by 25.2% in 2003. 
3. Still regarding the IPCA behavior in December, market prices increased 0.54%, being responsible for 0.38 p.p. in the total change, while the 0.47% rise in regulated prices accounted for the remaining 0.14 p.p.. In the first group, the main pressures came from clothing, tobacco, meat and rice. Regarding regulated prices, the main pressures came from health insurance and urban bus tariffs, which rose by 7.1% in Fortaleza and in Rio de Janeiro (in both cities, the second readjustment in 2003) and by 15% in Belém. 
4. Concerning wholesale prices, the 0.74% change of the IPA-DI in December (against 0.46% in November) reflected the elevation of both agricultural and industrial prices. The Agricultural-IPA rose 0.58% in the month, after a 0.26% increase in November. This upsurge was due to an increase in prices of fresh food products (a result of the rainy period) and to the inter-harvest period. Industrial prices rose 0.80%, above the 0.54% change in November, reflecting price readjustments in metals (mainly copper) and in the manufacturing sector (metallurgy, mechanics, electric equipment, wood and furniture, rubber, tobacco and food products). The monthly average price rise of textiles, clothing and shoes remained at a high level (2.08%), albeit lower than in November. 
5. Core IPCA inflation, calculated excluding household food items and regulated prices, posted a 0.63% variation in December, after five consecutive months of variations in the range between 0.35% and 0.40%. 
6. Core IPCA inflation calculated under the smoothed trimmed-mean method rose by 0.72% in December, from 0.56% in November. Accumulated variation in 12 months hit 11.11%, still reflecting the effects of price increases at the end of 2002. Inflation calculated without the smoothing procedure for pre-selected items reached 0.54% and 8.35%, respectively in the monthly and in the annual basis. 
7. Core IPC-Br inflation calculated under the symmetric trimmed-mean method increased to 0.46% in December, from 0.36% in November, accumulating 9.68% in the year. 
8. The surge in the core inflation measures reveals that the price increases in the last two months were not only due to seasonal factors, but affected most of the items included in the consumption basket. The ratio of goods with price rises in the IPCA increased to 64.8% in December, from 57.0% in November. 
9. In January, both wholesale and consumer inflation are expected to accelerate further. At the wholesale level, more intense seasonal pressures are expected from food prices. A recent survey unveiled that industries plan to accelerate price readjustments in the first quarter of 2004. Consumer inflation should also reflect the effects of seasonal price increases in food and the seasonal pressure in education prices. Amongst regulated prices, the impact of the readjustment of electricity tariffs in Rio de Janeiro should stand out. 
10. The identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available information. The scenario considered in the simulations assumes the following hypotheses: 
a. the projection for gasoline price readjustment for 2004 was kept at 9.5%. For bottled gas, there has been a revision in the projected price change for 2004 to 10% instead of the 3.5% expected in the December Copom meeting. This revision was a consequence of higher international oil prices and the current gap between the price charged at the refinery and the international price denominated in reais, 
b. for household electricity tariffs, the price readjustments projected for 2004 stand at 6.8%. Concerning fix telephone tariffs, the 6.6% readjustment projection was maintained. This projection assumes that the judicial decisions limiting tariffs readjustment in 2003 will not be reverted, 
c. Regarding all regulated prices, with a total weight of 28.9% in the December IPCA, the Copom maintained the 7.8% price change projection for 2004, 
d. the projection for the readjustment of regulated prices for 2005, of 5.4%, is based on the model of endogenous determination, which considers seasonal components, the exchange rate behavior, market prices inflation rate and the IGP-DI change, 
e. the projection for the 6-month spread over the Selic rate, following the specification of the Vector Autoregressive model using the Selic and swap rates on the eve of the Copom meeting, rose from –120 b.p. in the first quarter of 2004 to 50 b.p. in the end of 2005. 
11. Regarding fiscal policy, it is assumed that the primary surplus target of 4.25% of the GDP for this year and the following two years will be accomplished. The other related assumptions established in the previous meeting were maintained. 
12. Considering the benchmark scenario hypotheses, including the maintenance of the Selic interest rate at 16.5% p.a. and the exchange rate at the level prevailing on the eve of the January Copom meeting (R$2.84), inflation is projected below the target of 5.5% for 2004 and below the target of 4.5% for 2005. According to the market scenario, which takes into account the consensus exchange rate and the Selic rate paths as surveyed by the BCB’s Investor Relations Group on the eve of the Copom meeting, inflation is projected slightly above the target for 2004 and above the target for 2005. 
13. Inflation accelerated between November and December. Consumer inflation measured by the IPCA rose to 0.52% in December, from 0.34% in November. This acceleration was verified in the three sub-groups of the IPCA: tradable, non-tradable and regulated prices. The increase in inflation in December was also captured by other consumer price indices, as the IPC-Fipe and the IPC-Br, as well as the wholesale price indices (IPA-M and IPA-DI) and the general price indices (IGP-M and IGP-DI). Preliminary results for January do not anticipate any change in this pattern in the very short run. 
14. Core inflation measures also increased in December, showing that December’s figures cannot be attributed to the behavior of specific items. The higher increase was observed on core IPCA inflation calculated by excluding household food prices and regulated prices, which rose to 0.63% in December, after remaining stable in the range between 0.35% and 0.40% from July to November. Albeit in lower intensity, core IPCA and core IPC-Br calculated under the trimmed-mean method also increased in December. Another evidence that price increases are spreading out is the higher ratio of goods in the IPCA basket with positive variation, which increased to 64.8% in December, from 57.0% in November, the highest rate since May 2003.
15. Assessing all available information, the inflation increase in December might be an isolate occurrence owing to seasonal or one-off factors, or it might signal a persistent trend. It is certain that seasonal and extraordinary factors contributed to the December results. If this hypothesis is true, inflation will return to the target path in the medium term, similar to what happened last September. 
16. The Copom maintains the recovery scenario outlined in the last meetings. According to the IBGE, industrial output increased 0.8% in November, s.a., reaching the highest level ever. Between July and November, the quarterly moving average of industrial output increased 7.7%. Capital goods posted the highest increase (20.8%), while durable consumer goods grew 19.7%, as a result of increased credit supply. Only the segments of semi and non-durable consumer goods have not showed significant growth rates, as they depend more strongly on real earnings. Industrial output is likely to continue to expand as signaled by leading indicators such as electricity consumption, steel output and the flow of heavy vehicles in the highways. The low level of inventories in some sectors (e.g., automobiles) and the gradual recovery in real income and credit will contribute to higher industrial output. Capital goods absorption increased 27% between July and November, while production of inputs for civil construction increased 5% in the same period. This increase in investment is essential for a sustainable growth path, with no imbalances between supply and demand. 
17. Retail sales growth in November surpassed industrial production growth for the first time since the beginning of the upturn. According to IBGE data seasonally adjusted by the BCB, the volume of sales in Brazil rose by 2.1% between October and November. If the quarterly moving average is taken, the result in November was the sixth increase in a row. The growth was sharper in the sectors more dependent on credit, such as automobiles, furniture and appliances. Several indicators anticipate a continuous recovery of consumption, including stronger consumer sentiment, lower default rates, real payroll growth, and lower unemployment rate, which fell to 12.2% in November from 12.9% in October. 
18. The Copom restates that a stronger contribution of monetary policy to the recovery of less credit sensitive sectors in industry and retail should stem from its indirect impact, through higher employment and real earnings, both initially concentrated in the more sensitive sectors and gradually spreading over the whole economy. It should not be a result of additional monetary stimulus that could produce, in the short term, larger gaps between the recovery pace in the different activities and generate inflationary pressure in the leading ones. 
19. As in previous months, the performance of the external sector has been extremely favorable. There were good results both in trade balance and in the current account balance, the latter closing 2003 with a surplus of approximately US$4 billion – the first positive result since 1992. Besides, private external borrowing surpassed US$2 billion in the beginning of this year, and country-risk measured by J.P. Morgan Chase’s Embi+ remains in a downward trend, falling to 430b.p. from 480b.p. between the December and the January Copom meetings. Significant trade surpluses, an open international market for Brazilian companies and a more favorable scenario for the external accounts allowed the real to appreciate between the last Copom meetings. As a consequence, the dollar fell from R$2.94 to R$2.84, even after the BCB announced in the first week of January the start of an international reserves accumulation policy. 
20. Even though consistent with seasonal patterns, the recent inflation acceleration made market participants revise upwards their first quarter inflation expectations, a revision led by the most accurate market analysts in the short-term inflation forecasts. Between the eves of the last two Copom meetings, the median of market inflation expectations for the first quarter increased to 1.61% from 1.51%. However, when only the five most accurate forecasters are considered (the Top 5 forecasters), expected inflation rose to 1.68% from 1.48%. For 2004 as a whole and for 2005, the median of market inflation expectations remained stable, at 6.0% and 5.0%, respectively. 
21. The BCB inflation projections, according to the benchmark scenario (assuming unchanged Over-Selic rate at 16.5% p.a. and exchange rate at R$2.84/US$), are below the 5.5% target for 2004 and below the 4.5% target for 2005. Under the market scenario, which considers the exchange rate depreciation and the over-Selic rate decrease expected by market participants on the eve of the Copom meeting, BCB inflation estimates are slightly above the 5.5% target for 2004 and above the 4.5% target for 2005. 
22. One of the members of the Committee considered that a 0.25 p.p. cut in the target for the Over-Selic rate would be adequate in the current environment, taking into account the pace of recovery in activity, the stability of market inflation expectations for 2004 and 2005, the favorable exchange rate behavior, and the BCB inflation projections under the benchmark and the market scenarios. 
23. The other Committee members decided to keep the Over-Selic rate unchanged and to continue monetary easing only when there are more consistent signals that the risk of inflation deviating from its targets is low enough. Several considerations supported this decision. 
24. Differently from what was seen last September, in the current inflation acceleration episode, even one-off factors may trigger inflationary pressures for a longer period, as the impacts associated to increases in fresh food prices, education prices and electricity tariffs are higher than initially expected. If one-off inflation pressures are higher and longer than originally expected, the maneuver room for bringing inflation back to the target will be reduced in the first months of the year. 
25. Also differently from September, despite the fact that inflation pressures in December and in the first months of 2004 are partially seasonal and non-recurrent, they will hit the economy in a period of stronger demand. Therefore, there is more room for realignments in relative prices to develop into pressures on inflation. 
26. Even though there is no sufficient information to a precise diagnosis about the factors that caused the surge in inflation in December and the increase in inflation expectations in the January-February period, some signals suggest that this trend may persist. Firstly, as already outlined, core inflation and partial inflation figures for January do not anticipate an inflation slowdown. Secondly, the increase in the industrial IPA to 0.80% in December may put a pressure on consumer inflation over the next months, especially in a higher demand environment. The increase in wholesale prices was triggered by several factors, including increases in world commodity prices, higher demand for intermediate goods, and the change in relative prices that has benefited sectors more directly favored by the growth in demand, thus enabling increases in profit margins. 
27. The higher change of the industrial IPA differs from what happened last September, when the higher IPCA variation was accompanied by an increase in the agricultural IPA, while the industrial IPA remained well-behaved (0.40%). Stronger inflation pressures are also suggested by the FGV survey in January, which showed that 43% of the companies interviewed intended to increase prices in the first quarter of the year. Historical data show an important statistical correlation between those intentions and industrial wholesale prices. 
28. The recent appreciation of the real against the dollar is, undoubtedly, an important factor to be considered. However, the Copom believes that in the current environment the effects of this exchange rate appreciation over inflation will not be so intense as it was when the exchange rate floating was the main determinant of changes in tradable goods prices in reais. The US dollar depreciation in relation to other relevant currency, such as the euro and the Japanese yen, has to be accounted. Also, the world economy growth and the US dollar depreciation pushed commodity prices up, which may pressure wholesale prices in Brazil, as has been occurring. 
29. Stable inflation expectations for 2004 suggests that the market not only considers the first quarter inflation increase as temporary, but also believes that this increase will be compensated by reductions in the following quarters. If no exogenous factors trigger those reductions, it is assumed that monetary policy will be responsible for producing the compensatory effect. 
30. According to the forecasting exercises carried out by the BCB and described in the paragraph 21 above, when the inflation forecasts for the first quarter are substituted by the Top 5 inflation expectations (supposing unchanged Over-Selic rate and exchange rate), projected inflation come to the inflation target in 2004. This upward reevaluation is due to the new estimate of the first quarter inflation and its inertial impacts over the remaining quarters. When the exchange rate and the interest rate path expected by the market are taken, inflation is projected above the target of 5.5% in 2004 and above the target of 4.5% in 2005. 
31. The Copom understood that the recent inflation acceleration and the increase in inflation projections might not only be a one-off event, as occurred last September, but a possible accommodation of inflation at higher levels. Even taking for granted that this acceleration is really temporary, the increase in inflation projections is enough to suggest caution in monetary management. As already mentioned before, it is not possible to establish accurately the impacts of the 10 p.p. reduction of the Over-Selic rate between June and December 2003 over the output gap and inflation. Considering that there is a strong possibility that inflation deviates from the targets, monetary policy should act preemptively. A more prudent monetary management will not risk the upturn trend in course since the third quarter of 2003. 
32. Thus, the Copom weighted the risk of following with monetary easing and, in case inflation deviates from the targets, the need to change its policy in the medium term, with larger changes in interest rates and significant impacts over economic activity, against the risk, considered very low, of disrupting the recovery process due to the interruption of the monetary easing. Balancing the risks, the Copom understood to be more adequate to interrupt temporarily the monetary easing. This is the only way to retain the disinflation gains obtained during 2003, not endorsing price increases in the sectors that benefited from the rebound in demand to contaminate overall inflation. 
"
27/02/2004;93;Henrique Meirelles;"1. The main price indicators showed an inflation increase in January. The Broad Consumer Price Index (IPCA) rose 0.76% in January, compared to 0.52% in December, registering three consecutive monthly increases. The General Price Index – Domestic Supply (IGP-DI) rose 0.80% in January, after a 0.60% increase in December and a 0.48% increase in November. The IGP-DI change was influenced by the 0.75% increase in the Wholesale Price Index (IPA-DI) and by the 1.08% increase in the Consumer Price Index – Brazil (IPC-Br). The accumulated changes of the IPCA, IGP-DI and IPA-DI in twelve months sustained a downward trend in January, registering 7.71%, 6.22% and 4.75%, respectively. 
2. Concerning the São Paulo Consumer Price Index (IPC-Fipe), inflation diminished to 0.46% in the first week of February, from 0.65% in January. However, this decrease in the IPC-Fipe is not necessarily representative of the IPCA trend, as the indices encompass different geographical areas, different basket of goods and different methodologies. Both indices have also presented different behaviors in the recent past. In the last twelve months, the IPC-Fipe posted a 6.53% change, 1.18 p.p. lower than the IPCA change over the same period. The gap in the changes of prices in São Paulo and in the other areas in Brazil is also detected in the IPCA regional breakdown: in the last twelve months, the accumulated change of the São Paulo IPCA rose by 6.26%, while the average change in the other 10 cities surveyed rose by 8.51%. 
3. The more important individual contributions for the IPCA result in January were electricity tariffs, car prices, fresh food products, rice, beans and bottled gas, which altogether accounted for 0.28 p.p. of the total change of the index. Market prices changed 0.73% in the month, contributing 0.52 p.p. to the overall result of IPCA, while the 0.84% increase in regulated prices contributed 0.24 p.p. Among the latter, the higher contributions came from electricity, bottled gas, gasoline, alcohol-based auto fuel and health insurance plans. 
4. Concerning wholesale prices, the IPA-DI remained roughly stable at 0.75% in January. This behavior resulted from the reduction of agricultural prices and from the increase of industrial prices. The Agricultural IPA registered a -0.34% variation in January, after rising 0.58% in December, mainly reflecting the falls in the prices of meat, chicken, milk and egg products, which more than compensated the price increases of fresh food items, coffee and beans. The Industrial IPA posted a 1.20% change, compared to 0.80% in December, the third consecutive acceleration. The higher contributions to the Industrial IPA acceleration came from the metallurgy industry (iron, non-iron metals, steel and by-products), chemical industry (plastics, fertilizers and others) and transportation industry. For fabrics, clothing and shoes, the monthly change remained stable, albeit in a high level for the third consecutive month, still reflecting the effects of cotton price increase. 
5. Core IPCA inflation, calculated excluding household food items and regulated prices, posted a 0.64% increase in January, remaining relatively stable in comparison to the 0.63% variation in December. Transportation and personal expenses have contributed more intensely to this result. Considering the accumulated change in twelve months, the core registered a 7.39% variation in January, compared to an 8.17% variation in December. 
6. The variation of the IPCA core inflation, calculated under the smoothed trimmed-mean method, reached 0.73% in January compared to 0.72% in December. The 12-month accumulated change posted 10.47%. The same measure, without the smoothing procedure, showed acceleration for the third consecutive month, reaching 0.63% in comparison to 0.54% in the previous month. 
7. Core IPC-Br inflation calculated under the symmetric trimmed-mean method by Fundação Getúlio Vargas (FGV) reached 0.65% in January, compared to 0.46% in December, accumulating an increase of 8.95% in the last 12 months. 
8. The effects of the food prices recent slowdown – reflecting the beginning of the harvest period and the fall of fresh food prices – is likely to moderate the remaining pressures on inflation in February. Such trend is already noticeable in the partial results already disclosed for February wholesale inflation. As to industrial prices, it should continue to reflect the costs increases. Regarding the IPCA, the favorable evolution of food prices should be offset by the price increases in education, health insurance plans and telephone tariffs. 
9. The identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available information. The scenario considered in the simulations assumes the following hypotheses: 
a. Gasoline and bottled cooking gas price projections for 2004 were maintained at 9.5% and 10%, respectively, 
b. Household electricity tariffs are expected to increase 6.3% in 2004, a reduction of 0.5 p.p. compared to the expectation in the last Copom meeting. The projections for telephone tariffs were slightly risen, by 0.2 p.p., reaching 6.8%, 
c. Regarding all regulated prices, with a total weight of 28.9% in the January IPCA, the Copom maintained the projection for 2004 nearly unchanged at 7.7%, 
d. The projection for the readjustments of regulated prices in 2005, based on the endogenous determination model, increased to 6.0% from 5.4%. This model takes into account seasonal factors, the exchange rate behavior, market prices change and the IGP inflation rate, 
e. The projection for the trajectory of the 6-month spread over the Selic rate, following the specification of a Vector Autoregressive model using the Selic and swap rates on the eve of the Copom meeting, reached 17.1% in the fourth quarter of 2005. 
10. Regarding fiscal policy, it is assumed that the primary surplus target of 4.25% of the GDP for 2004 and the following two years will be achieved. The related assumptions considered in the previous meeting were maintained. 
11. Considering the benchmark scenario hypotheses, including the maintenance of the Selic interest rate at 16.5% p.a. and of the exchange rate close to the level prevailing on the eve of the Copom meeting (R$2,91), IPCA inflation was projected below the 5.5% target for 2004. Inflation projections based on the trajectories of the exchange rate and Selic rate expected by market participants on the eve of the meeting, gathered by the BCB´s Investor Relations Group (Gerin), were above the central targets of 5.5% and 4.5% for 2004 and 2005, respectively. 
12. The inflation rate accelerated from December to January. The 0.76% IPCA variation in January was significantly higher than market consensus on the eve of the December Copom meeting (0.60%). Inflation for the three groups in the IPCA – tradable, non-tradable and regulated items – stood high and/or increased in January. For tradable goods, the January result remained similar to the one observed in December, around 0.5%. Non-tradable and regulated prices changes departed from an already high level in December and increased about 0.4 p.p. in January, posting 0.97% and 0.84%, respectively, the third consecutive rise for both series. 
13. The IPC-Br accelerated to 1.08% in January, from 0.43% in December. Inflation measured by the general price indices (IGP-M and IGP-DI) and by the IPA-M also rose in January. Inflation measured by the IPA-DI remained practically stable from December to January, but at a high rate (0.75%), in spite of being strongly favored by the Agricultural IPA 0.34% fall. The Industrial IPA rose for the third month in a row and reached 1.20% in January, the highest figure since March 2003. 
14. Core inflation measures remained practically stable in January, in a level inconsistent with the inflation targets. The core IPCA calculated by excluding household food items and regulated prices posted 0.64% in January, close to the variation observed in December, but higher than that of November (0.38%). The core IPCA calculated under the smoothed trimmed-mean method presented a similar behavior: 0.56% in November, 0.72% in December and 0.73% in January. The core IPC-Br calculated under the symmetric trimmed-mean method rose to 0.65% in January, from 0.46% in December. The ratio of items with positive variations in the IPCA increased to 70.9% in January, from 64.8% in December, the highest level since April 2003. 
15. Economic activity indicators remain consistent with the economic recovery scenario that the Copom has been working with in the last months. After a significant fall in the first half of 2003, industrial production presented strong growth in the second half of the year. The industrial production quarterly moving average accumulated a 5.1% growth from June to December, seasonally adjusted. For the same period, durable goods and capital goods output production presented an 18.4% and 12.3% growth, respectively. 
16. In the same period, the semi and non-durable goods output, strongly influenced by real earnings, registered a 1.8% drop (quarterly moving average). The Copom stresses the remarks made in the January meeting minutes that these sectors recovery will come naturally, as a consequence of the gradual dissemination of growth throughout the economy. An excessive monetary easing with the objective of pushing these specific sectors forward would intensify, in the short run, the recovery gaps amongst sectors, and would allow for inflationary pressures to arise from leading sectors. 
17. In December, industrial output presented a 1% fall, seasonally adjusted, in relation to the previous month. When the quarterly moving average is taken, the output decrease in December diminishes to 0.1%, month-on-month, and is close to the December 2000 historical peak. Volatility around the underlying output trend is normal in periods of economic recovery. This volatility does not indicate that the economic rebound process is losing steam, especially because the monetary easing that took place in the second half of 2003 has not yet fully materialized. 
18. Industrial sales growth surpassed industrial production growth for the third consecutive month. In the second half of 2003, industrial sales increased 2.5 p.p. more than industrial output. This gap augmented in the fourth quarter, when industrial sales increased 4.3 p.p. more than output. The different growth rates suggest a higher expansionary stimulus for industrial output in the short-term, coming from the inventories build-up dynamics, as well as from improved consumer confidence, real earnings growth and credit expansion. 
19. According to IBGE data seasonally adjusted by the BCB, retail sales quarterly moving average grew 0.5% in December, compared to November, and 2.9% from June to December. As for industrial sales, retail sales growth was led by sectors directly favored with credit expansion, as furniture and appliances (14.4% from June to December), and automobiles and motorcycles (16.2% for the same period). The most likely scenario is a continuous recovery in consumption as a consequence of improved consumer sentiment, higher real payrolls and lower consumer default rates. 
20. As in previous months, the external sector continued to post a positive performance. In January, exports and imports increased 26.5% and 20.9%, respectively, compared to January 2003. The trade balance and the current account registered an US$1.6 billion and a US$0.7 billion surplus, respectively. There was an increase in the sovereign risk perception due to market concern about an earlier-than-expected rise in US interest rates and its impact in emerging markets liquidity. As a consequence, the Brazil Embi+ increased nearly 100 b.p., to 520 b.p. between the January and the February Copom meetings. In the same period, private external funding diminished and the dollar appreciated from R$2.84 to R$2.91. Nonetheless, the external scenario remains positive, with favorable perspectives for global growth, increase in demand for Brazilian exports and adequate liquidity conditions. 
21. First quarter market inflation expectations have been increasing since December. The inflation in January was higher than market consensus and preliminary data suggest that February inflation will also be higher than the previous forecast. Considering the eves of the Copom meetings, the median of the first quarter inflation expectations for the five most accurate short-term forecasters (the Top 5 short-term forecasters) increased to 1.98% in February from 1.68% in January and 1.48% in December. The median of the market inflation expectations rose to 1.90% in February from 1.51% in December. Despite higher expectations for the first quarter inflation, the medians for 2004 and 2005 inflation remained stable at 6.0% and 5.0%, respectively. 
22. The BCB inflation forecasts, according to the benchmark scenario (assuming unchanged Over-Selic rate at 16.5% p.a. and exchange rate at R$2,91/US$), are below the 5.5% target for 2004 and below the 4.5% target for 2005. Compared to January, there was an increase in the inflation projection for 2004, due to higher-than-anticipated inflation in January and due to the impact of the exchange rate depreciation. The forecast for 2005 remained unaltered. Under the market scenario, which takes into account the path for the exchange rate and the Over-Selic rate expected by market participants on the eve of the Copom meeting, the BCB inflation estimates are above the targets for 2004 and 2005. 
23. The Copom also examined the inflation projections produced according to the same methodology and according to the same benchmark and market scenarios, taking into account the Top 5 short-term inflation expectations for February and March, and hence projecting inflation for the following months. In this exercise, the projected inflation for 2004 is slightly above the target even in the benchmark scenario, although the projection for 2005 remains below the target. The same procedure considering the market scenario shows an increased difference between the projected inflation rate and the targets for 2004 and 2005. 
24. Considering the post-Real Plan period, the January inflation was the highest in the first quarter in 7 out of 9 years. It is justified to expect that this seasonal behavior persists and that the February inflation shows some reversion in relation to January. However, since the January meeting, the Copom has not yet identified factors that could reduce the risks of an inflation higher than the 5.5% target for 2004. First, the IPCA and the different core measures in January, as well as the expectations for February, do not point out any reduction trend. Preliminary evidence of an inflation deceleration can be found in the partial results of the IPC-Fipe and the weekly IPC-S. For the IPC-S, however, inflation persists at a high level, for the IPC-Fipe, the reduction was more intense, and yet, due to the reasons described in paragraph 2 above, this pattern may not be the same for the IPCA. Second, inflation measured by the Industrial IPA remained high and accelerated, influenced by an increase in some commodities prices, by a higher demand for inputs and by the relative price realignment, favoring the sectors that benefited from stronger demand. Although a higher wholesale inflation will not necessarily be transmitted to consumers with the same intensity, a higher passthrough would happen as a consequence of the perception of a lenient monetary policy and of an over-optimistic scenario produced by the recovery of certain sectors. 
25. Even considering that the recent inflation increase was caused by seasonal and one-off factors, and considering the return of inflation to a path consistent with the inflation target in the near future, the achievement of the 5.5% target for 2004 will require a more cautious monetary policy, as a result of higher inflation in January and of higher short-term inflation expectations. 
26. Consequently, and considering the uncertainties about the magnitude and the lags on the output gap and on inflation of the 10 p.p. reduction in the Over-Selic rate that took place from June to December, the Copom maintains the January minutes diagnosis, that there is a real likelihood that inflation deviates from the target, requiring an extra concern in monetary policymaking. 
27. The balance between the risks of inflation deviating from the target and the interruption in the economy recovery process has not changed significantly since January. Resuming monetary easing prematurely can significantly increase the risk that actual inflation deviates from the target, which could force a change in monetary stance in the medium run, with strong interest rates movements and a significant effect on economic activity. On the other hand, an unchanged Over-Selic rate causes a substantial lower risk of damaging the process of economy recovery. 
"
30/03/2004;94;Henrique Meirelles;"1. In February, there was price deceleration in most part of consumer goods. This fact impacted the evolution of both consumer price indices and core inflation measures, which cooled down in the month. However, there are still pressures coming from the rise in the international prices of commodities, especially over wholesale industrial prices. Yet, it is important to highlight the effects of the change in the Cofins legislation over the relative prices, whose most evident impacts also affect wholesale industrial prices. 
2. The Broad National Consumer Price Index (IPCA) rose 0.61% in February, before a 0.76% rise in the previous month, after three consecutive months of acceleration. The IGP-DI reached 1.08%, remaining in an upward trend for the fourth consecutive month. This acceleration, in comparison to the one verified in the previous month, was mainly a consequence of the IPA-DI acceleration to 1.42% from the 0.75% previously recorded, once that the IPC-Br decelerated to 0.28% in February, from 1.08% in January. The 12-month accumulated variation of the IPCA, IGP-DI and IPA-DI remained in a downward trend in February, standing at 6.69%, 5.69% and 4.45%, respectively. 
3. The most important individual contribution to the IPCA variation came from the readjustment of school fees, with a 0.31 p.p. contribution to the overall monthly index. The group food and beverage items, which recorded a variation of 0.15% compared to the 0.88% increase in the previous month, reflected the effects of the new harvest into prices, a paramount factor that contributed to the IPCA deceleration in February. The fall in the prices of fuel-alcohol is also highlighted, as a consequence of an excessive production. 
4. Still regarding the February IPCA, free prices increased 0.75%, accounting for 0.54 p.p. of the monthly index variation, while the 0.26% increase in the regulated prices accounted for the remaining 0.07p.p. In the first group, the rise in school fees and in the prices of cars, fresh food items and beans are highlighted. Concerning regulated prices, the rise in water and sewage tariffs as well as in the prices of bottled gas and health insurance prevailed, fact that was partially offset by the decrease in fuel prices. 
5. The Wholesale Price Index (IPA) presented a 1.42% variation in February, compared to the 0.75% variation in the previous month. Despite the continuous fall in agriculture prices, industrial prices showed sharp increase in the period. The agriculture IPA dropped 0.76% in February, compared to the 0.34% fall in January. This pattern reflects mainly a trend reversion in the prices of cereals and grains (rice, beans and corn) due to the new harvest period. The price decreases in the group animal and by products (cattle, pork and milk) also contributed to the negative IPA result. The industrial prices variation reached 2.3%, as against a 1.2% increase in January, mainly influenced by the price behavior of food products (oils and greases), chemical products (plastic materials and fertilizers), mechanics and electric material. The rise in metallurgy prices (iron, steel and by products, and non-ferrous metals) still presented the greatest contribution to the absolute variation of the industrial IPA, 0.36 p.p., despite the decrease in the monthly variation from January (5.2%) to February (4%). It is worth mentioning that the generalized pattern of items with positive variations in the industrial-IPA – 66.7% of the items presented price increases – indicates the influence of the change in the Cofins legislation over prices. 
6. The core IPCA inflation calculated excluding household food items and regulated prices was the only core measure to increase in February, posting a 1% rise in the month, in comparison to a 0.64% increase in January. The intense variation of school fees, with a total weight of 8.8% in the IPCA, explains the rise in the index in the period. The 12-month accumulated variation stood at 7.39% in February, repeating the previous month result. 
7. The core IPCA inflation calculated under the smoothed trimmed-mean method rose to 0.48% in February against 0.73% in January, posting a 9.97% accumulated variation in the last 12 months. The result calculated without the smoothing procedure for pre-selected items reached 0.28% in February, in comparison to 0.63% in the previous month. The 12-month accumulated variation totaled 6.45%, the lowest result recorded since the end of 2002. 
8. Core IPC-BR inflation, calculated under the symmetric trimmed-mean method by Fundação Getúlio Vargas (FGV), reduced to 0.46% in February, compared to 0.65% in January, posting an 8.45% accumulated variation in the last 12 months. 
9. The consumer prices deceleration is expected to continue in March, and the IPCA should show this behavior, following the food items trend and the end of educational items readjustments. As to the wholesale prices, agriculture prices should maintain their favorable performance, reflecting the price trends of cereals and fresh food items. Industrial prices should be pressured by inputs readjustments, albeit in a lower intensity than the one observed in February. 
10. The identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to new available information. The scenario considered in the simulations assumes the following hypotheses: 
a. The projections for the evolution of gasoline and bottled cooking gas prices in 2004 were maintained at 9.5% and 10%, respectively, 
b. The projection for household electricity tariffs was slightly increased to 6.9%, from 6.3% in the previous Copom meeting. Regarding telephone tariffs, the assumption of a 6.8% elevation in 2004 was maintained, 
c. Regarding all regulated prices, with a total weight of 28.9% in the February IPCA, a 7.3% rise is projected, 0.4 p.p. below the projection made in the previous meeting, 
d. The projection for the readjustment of all regulated prices for 2005 was maintained at 6.0%. This figure results from a model of endogenous determination, which takes into account seasonal components, the exchange rate behavior, market prices inflation and the IGP-DI change, 
e. The projection for the 6-month spread over the Selic rate, following the specification of a Vector Autoregressive model using the Selic and swap rates on the eve of the Copom meeting, starts from an –80 b.p. average in the first quarter of 2004 and reaches 50 b.p. in the end of 2005. 
11. Regarding fiscal policy, it is assumed that the primary surplus target of 4.25% of the GDP for 2004 and the following two years will be achieved. The related assumptions considered in the previous meeting were maintained. 
12. Considering the benchmark scenario hypotheses, including the maintenance of the Selic interest rate at 16.5% p.a. and of the exchange rate close to the level prevailing on the eve of the Copom meeting (R$2.91), IPCA inflation was projected below the 5.5% target for 2004 and below the 4.5% target for 2005. According to the market scenario, which takes into account the consensus exchange rate and Selic rate paths as surveyed by the BCB´s Investor Relations Group (Gerin) on the eve of the Copom meeting, inflation is projected above the central targets of 5.5% and 4.5% for 2004 and 2005, respectively. 
13. After three consecutive months of increases, the inflation registered by the IPCA decreased to 0.61% in February, 0.15 p.p. below the January result. There was a significant decrease in inflation in tradable and regulated items, which fell to 0.07% and 0.26%, respectively. Inflation in the non-tradable items rose almost 0.7 p.p. in the period, reaching 1.64% in February, strongly influenced by the increase in school fees. If this item were excluded, non-tradable items inflation would have been 0.73%, what would represent a 0.24 p.p. fall, compared to January. Inflation measured by other consumer price indices, such as IPC-Fipe and IPC-Br, showed a decrease of 0.5 p.p. and 0.8 p.p., respectively, compared to January. However, general price indices showed mixed evidences, with a decrease in the IGP-M and an increase in the IGP-DI. This increase was mainly caused by the higher inflation in wholesale industrial prices, which reached 2.29% in February, 1.1 p.p. above the value registered in January. 
14. The fall of consumer inflation in February can be more clearly seen in the behavior of the core inflation calculated under the trimmed-mean method. Core inflation calculated under the smoothing of pre-selected items method decreased to 0.48% from 0.73%, the lowest figure recorded since June 2002, and the core inflation calculated without the smoothing procedure decreased to 0.28% from 0.63%. Core inflation calculated by excluding household food items and regulated prices rose to 1.00% from 0.65%. However, as occurred in the non-tradable items group, this increase is due to the school fees behavior. If this item were excluded, core inflation calculated by excluding household food items and regulated prices would have decreased to 0.45% in February. The better behavior of consumer inflation can also be seen in the the drop in the IPC-Br core and in the ratio of items of the IPCA with positive variation in the month, which decreased to 60.4% from 70.9%, below the average observed in the last three quarters of 2003. 
15. According to the IBGE, the GDP fell 0.2% in 2003, in relation to 2002. Despite the fact that the GDP growth stood below the expected, output performance remained qualitatively consistent with the benchmark scenario that the Copom has been working with, especially regarding the economic cycle. More specifically, in the second semester of 2003, the economy began a recovery process, and posted a 1.5% growth in the last quarter of the year, compared to the previous quarter, which is equivalent to an annual rate of more than 6%. Economic indicators available so far suggest that there has been a sustained economic growth path at the beginning of the year. Due to the significant growth in the last quarter of 2003, it is likely that the GDP data in the first quarter of 2004 indicate a cooling down on economic activity. 
16. Industrial production kept the recovery trend, having presented a 0.8% growth in January, compared to December, according to the IBGE seasonally adjusted data. Semi and non-durable goods output presented growth for the first time since last September, suggesting that growth recorded in the other sectors of economy has been influencing this sector, which had not presented recovery so far, through the marginal increase in employment and real earnings. Quarterly moving average behavior has presented a continuous industrial output growth, although in lower rates than the ones recorded in the last quarter of 2003. For February, considering previous indicators, it is not possible to discard a fall in the industrial production, which is perfectly compatible with the usual patterns of a sustained growth recovery, with short-term oscillations around the trend. Moreover, in February there were only eighteen working days, as against twenty working days in the same month of 2003, harming the comparison against the same month in 2003. In addition, in two out of the five last years, Carnival was in March, which may affect the seasonal adjustment of the series. Industrial production can benefit from the low inventory levels, compensating the negative short-term scenario. Considering that different sources provide data for industrial sales and industrial production, for the fourth consecutive month the former recorded higher growth than the latter, which was 2.8% in January, according to the National Confederation of Industry (CNI). This fact may give additional stimulus to production, associated to the inventories build-up dynamics. 
17. According to IBGE data, seasonally adjusted by the BCB, retail sales fell 0.3% from November to December. Yet, retail sales in São Paulo grew 8.7% in January, in relation to the previous month, according to Fecomercio data, seasonally adjusted by the BCB. Considering the behavior of new credit concessions, it is likely that the data on the January-February period show some decrease in the consumption of durable goods, such as automobiles, furniture and domestic appliances. In March, the Consumer Intention Index (IIC) stood above the critic value of 100, signaling that there are positive perspectives, however, the fall in relation to February suggests lower consumption growth in the short-term. Following the growth in the real income observed in the last months of 2003, supermarket sales, which concentrate non-durable goods, have presented progressive recovery. 
18. The consolidation of positive data in the economic activity continues to be followed by expressive indicators in the external sector, posting a favorable combination of economic policy results that had not been seen in Brazil for several years. In February, the trade balance surplus reached US$2 billion and, for 2004, a US$24 billion surplus is forecasted, which is a very satisfactory result considering the expected economic growth for this year. Compared to the same period last year, in February, exports and imports grew 27.1% and 6.9%, respectively. Due to the favorable performance of the trade balance, the current account result presented a surplus in February, accumulating US$0.9 billion in 2004. Despite the excellent results in the external accounts, there was an increase in the sovereign risk perception: the country-risk measured by the Brazil Embi+ increased to 560 b.p. from values around 520 p.b. from the February to the March eves of the Copom meetings, after having increased almost 100 p.b. from January to February. In spite of the reduction in the private external funding, the dollar remained stable, at values around R$2.90 on the eve of the Copom meeting. Regardless of the higher volatility that has been observed in the last two months, the Copom maintains the evaluation that the external scenario is very favorable, presenting perspective of world economic growth and high international liquidity. 
19. After three consecutive months of deterioration, inflation expectations for the first quarter of 2004 dropped, according to a survey conducted by the Investor Relations Group – Gerin. The 0.61% inflation in February was bellow the 0.70% expected on the eve of the previous Copom meeting. The median of March inflation expectations also dropped from the eve of the February meeting to the March meeting, to 0.42% from 0.43%, for the full sample of the institutions participating in the survey, and to 0.40% from 0.43%, for the institutions with more accurate forecasts in the short run (Top 5 Forecasting Institutions). Hence, for the full sample, the expectation for the first quarter fell to 1.80% from 1.90%, and for the Top 5 Forecasting Institutions, it fell to 1.78% from 1.98%. The median of market expectations to 2004 and 2005 remained stable at 6.0% and 5.0% respectively, and the expectations to the next 12 months decreased to 5.41% from 5.70% in the period. 
20. According to the benchmark scenario considered by the BCB inflation forecasts, which assumes the maintenance of the Over-Selic rate at 16.5% p.a. and the foreign exchange rate at R$2.91, the projected inflation is below the targets of 5.5% for 2004 and 4.5% for 2005. In accordance with the market scenario, which includes the market expected path to the exchange rate and to the Over-Selic rate on the eve of the Copom meeting, the BCB inflation forecasts lie above the targets for 2004 and 2005. Compared to February, there was an increase in the projections, because in both scenarios the February inflation forecast was much below the effective one, even though both of them considered a GDP growth for the fourth quarter above the effective, a regulated prices variation greater than expected by the Copom, which has been revised downwards since its meeting in February, and a 12-month-ahead inflation expectations higher than the ones currently verified. 
21. As in previous meetings, the Copom also examined the projections produced according to the same methodology, and according to the same benchmark and market scenarios for the interest and exchange rates paths, taking into account the Top 5 short-term inflation expectations for March and hence, projecting inflation for the following months. In this exercise, considering the benchmark scenario, the projected inflation for 2004 is slightly above the target, and for 2005, it is bellow the target. However, the projected inflation for 2004 and 2005 are below the February results for the same exercise, due to the substitution of the lower figure effectively observed for the expected inflation of the Top 5 forecasters for the month of February, to the reduction of expected inflation by those institutions for March and to the reasons mentioned in the paragraph above, regarding the GDP performance in 2003, the reduction in the projection for the regulated prices for 2004 and the downwards improvement of the 12-months-ahead inflation expectations. According to the same methodology, the projected inflation for the market scenario is above the 2004 and 2005 targets, although lower than the ones projected in February, due to the same reasons mentioned above. 
22. The Copom also evaluated a third set of scenarios, which supposes lower inflation persistence. These scenarios consider the hypothesis under which part of the high inflation of the first quarter of the year will not impact the following quarters’ and that there could even be a reversion in the inflation increases that occurred in the period due to momentary unfavorable weather conditions. This hypothesis becomes more likely the more efficient the monetary policy is in exercising its coordinating role, preventing punctual inflation increases caused by supply shocks, by seasonal factors and by attempts to restore margins from contaminating inflation expectations. For this hypothesis the Copom considered that part of inflation in the first quarter was due to a seasonal shock and that other shocks of the same fashion will also affect inflation in each quarter of the year and in 2005. The magnitude of each quarterly typical shock was estimated to reproduce, in the Copom projection models, the same seasonal standard observed in the recent series of free prices. As in the exercise described in the previous paragraph, the inflation of the first quarter is the one expected by the short-term Top 5 institutions. According to this procedure, considering the benchmark scenario exchange and interest rates trajectories, the forecast inflations for 2004 and 2005 are below the targets. When market expected exchange and interest rates are considered, inflation remains above the target for 2004, although closer to the target value than in the exercise that only encompasses the expectations of the Top 5 institutions for the first quarter, and the inflation for 2005 remains unchanged. 
23. The Copom members evaluated that the risk of not fulfilling the 2004 inflation target reduced since the last meeting, due to the IPCA result and its cores in February and to lower inflation expectations for the short run and for the next twelve months. Moreover, it was consensual that the evaluation of this more favorable scenario is a result of the recent monetary policy decisions, which have been mitigating the pass-through from the rises in industrial costs to retail costs and the second order effects of inflationary surprises of January and February. The conduction of the monetary policy at the beginning of the year was decisive to revert the environment in which the leading sectors in the economic rebound could pressure prices upward, expecting that demand conditions would absorb the increases. Therefore, the risk of higher inflation diminished while the risk of unsustained economic activity remained low. 
24. It was also consensual the interpretation that the main risk for consumer inflation in the next months consists on the contamination of the increases of wholesale industrial prices to retail prices. It is important to notice that this element is not incorporated into any of the projected scenarios analyzed above, except for the limited effects on the results of the IPCA for the first quarter, since there is no perceptible signal of transmission through any other channel, such as market expectations for the IPCA during the next quarters. The experience of the last years suggests that when the industrial IPA pass-through influences the part of IPCA represented by the industrialized products, it is usually fast. In this sense, the recent results of the deceleration of consumer prices are quite encouraging, despite the acceleration of the wholesale prices. The usual high speed of this pass-through enables to foresee that the remaining uncertainties about the increase in consumer prices as a result of pressures caused by wholesale prices will soon be solved. 
25. Great part of the increase in wholesale prices in the last months can be explained by supply shocks, among which the different impacts caused by the Cofins ratio and levies throughout the productive chains and the increase in the international price of some commodities and intermediate inputs. There are still no elements allowing for a satisfactorily accurate measure of the magnitude of the potential impact of these shocks over the consumer prices, although there are preliminary indications, for example, that the effect of the Cofins may be small. Economic theory and the best monetary policy practice recommend the partial accommodation of increases in consumer prices caused by supply shocks. The Copom adopted this procedure in the recent past, announcing during 2002 revisions in the objective to be sought in that year and establishing adjusted targets for the inflation in 2003 and 2004. However, there is no automatic procedure that can be adopted in any circumstance, as the optimum degree of accommodation may depend on factors such as the stage of the economic cycle at which the economy is found, the unique demand conditions among the sectors that are differently affected by the shocks, the distance between current inflation and the desirable inflation in the medium and long terms, and the direct response of the private agents’ inflation expectations to the shock. The Copom understands that the current circumstances do not recommend the adoption of procedures willing to accommodate the recent supply shocks. 
26. Three members of the Copom considered more appropriate to keep unchanged the basic Over-Selic rate in this meeting. These members recommended greater caution in the conduct of the monetary policy in the short term, proposing that eventual cuts in the target for the Over-Selic rate should be left for a subsequent moment, when there may be additional evidences that the higher inflation rates of January and February might not contaminate the inflation of the following months and when the impact of the recent increases in the wholesale prices over the future dynamics of the consumer prices may not be significant. This caution would increase the probability of both a steady anchorage of the inflationary expectations and the behavior of the price-makers to consolidate a favorable level of inflation, such as the one considered by the scenarios of low inflation persistence analyzed by the Copom. Therefore, these three members voted for the maintenance of the target for the Over-Selic rate at 16,5% a.a. 
27. However, for most part of the members of the Copom, the immediate fall of the Over-Selic rate in 0.25 p.p can be justified by the recent behavior of the price indices, the lower inflation expectation for both the short-term and the next twelve months and the low intensity of the wholesale pass-through to the retail prices. These considerations indicate that the maintenance of the Over-Selic rate in January and February was enough to increase the probability of materialization of low inflationary persistence scenarios considered by the Committee, moving away the danger that the inflation increase recorded from December to February could contaminate inflation expectations and provoke a change in the inflationary dynamics. Therefore, this easing of the monetary policy reflects the necessary caution in the administration of the risks between inflation and the continuity of the restore of the economic activity. 
"
26/04/2004;95;Henrique Meirelles;"1. The inflation recorded deceleration in March, confirming the expectations for the period. The Broad National Consumer Price Index (IPCA) registered 0.47% in March, compared to 0.61% in February, accumulating 1.85% in the first quarter of 2004. The IGP-DI reached 0.93% in March, compared to 1.08% registered in the previous month, totaling 2.84% in the first quarter of the year. This performance was mainly a consequence of the Wholesale Price Index (IPA-DI) behavior, with an increase of 1.09% in the month and of 3.30% in the first quarter of the year. The 12-month accumulated changes of the IPCA, IGP-DI and IPA-DI remained in a downward trend in March, standing at 5.89%, 4.94% and 3.59%, respectively. 
2. Regarding the IPCA, the reduction of the monthly change was mainly due to the smaller impact of the school fees readjustment in the month. This readjustment was the main factor of pressure in February. In addition, fuel-alcohol prices remained on a declining trend (-12.87%), reflecting a favorable harvest of sugar cane. 
3. The main individual contribution to the March IPCA inflation came from new cars prices, 0.07 p.p., due to a 2.33% increase registered as a consequence of rise in production costs, as well as of the end of the special tax on industrialized products regime. Amongst the items with greater price increase, one highlights cigarettes, with a total contribution of 0.06 p.p., and sewage and water supply, with price readjustment in four cities, with 0.05 p.p. Food and beverages registered a 0.43% increase, compared to the 0.15% increase in February, mainly driven by the prices of soy oil and eggs. 
4. Regarding regulated prices, there has recently been above-than-expected price increases in certain items. As an example, the price readjustments for sewage and water supply in Brasília and Belo Horizonte reached 20% and 21%, respectively, much higher figures than any 12-month accumulated inflation index. In addition to this item, recent announcements of price readjustments of electricity in Minas Gerais and Pernambuco are also above previously expected. These increases consider inflation-indexed costs, price increases due to investments in the distribution and a part of the 2003 readjustment that is being applied this year. 
5. Still regarding the IPCA evolution in March, market prices changed 0.69%, accounting for 0.49 p.p. of the monthly variation of the index, while the 0.07% fall in the regulated prices contributed with –0.02 p.p. In the first group, the rise of tradable goods prices contributed 0.27 p.p. for the IPCA monthly change, while non-tradable goods contributed with 0.22 p.p. Regarding regulated prices, the negative change was due to the reduction of fuel prices, which prevailed over the increases of water and sewage tariffs and bottled gas prices. 
6. The IPA-DI decreased 1.09% in March, in comparison to 1.42% in February. This result followed the industrial prices trajectory, as the Agricultural IPA reverted its trend in March, after reductions of 0.76% an 0.34% in February and January, respectively, mainly due to price increases of 10.98%, 12.17% and 7.01% of soy, eggs and fresh food items, respectively. However, the prices of rice, cattle and sugar cane remained in a downward trend. 
7. Industrial IPA rose 0.94% in March, compared to 2.29% in February, mostly influenced by prices of the following items: chemicals (decrease in alcohol prices and deceleration of price rises of both plastic and fertilizers), food products (with the effects of oil and fat losing ground), mechanics, electric material, wood and furniture, paper and cardboard, rubber, and fabric, clothing and shoes (deceleration of rises). Price increases in the metallurgy sector (iron, steel and by-products and non-ferrous metals) continued to present the highest contributions to the absolute Industrial IPA change (0.37 p.p.) in March, when the variation stood at the same level registered in the month, 4%. 
8. The core IPCA inflation calculated excluding household food items and regulated prices was the only core measure to decrease in March, to 0.85% compared to a 1.00% rise in February, partially due to the end of school fees rises that had been pressuring the previous month results. The 12-month accumulated change reached 7.09% in March. 
9. The core IPCA inflation calculated under the smoothed trimmed-mean method rose to 0.76% in March from 0.48% in February, posting a 9.47% accumulated variation in the last 12 months. The result calculated without the smoothing procedure for pre-selected items reached 0.65% in March, accumulating 6.11% in 12 months. As occurred with the full IPCA, the 12-month accumulated core indices registered in March the lowest changes since the end of 2002, despite being above the full IPCA change. 
10. Core IPC-BR inflation, calculated under the symmetric trimmed-mean method by Fundação Getúlio Vargas (FGV), rose to 0.53% in March, compared to 0.46% in February, accumulating 7.87% in the last 12 months. 
11. In April, consumer price indices should be influenced by price rises of medicine and clothing, and, among regulated items, of water and sewage and household electricity. The magnitude and the pace of the pass-through of wholesale industrial price increases to consumer prices have been unsurprised. 
12. The identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to new available information. The scenario considered in the simulations assumes the following hypotheses: 
a. The projections for the evolution of gasoline prices in 2004 were maintained at 9.5%. The projections for bottled cooking gas were revised to 6.9% in the year, 3.1 p.p. below March projections, 
b. The projection for household electricity tariffs increased to 8.5% from 6.9% since the last Copom meeting. Regarding telephone tariffs, the Copom maintained its projections practically unchanged, from 6.8% in the previous meeting to 6.7%, 
c. Regarding all regulated prices, with a total weight of 28.8% in the March IPCA, a 7.4% rise is projected, 0.1 p.p. above the projection made in the previous meeting, 
d. The projection for the readjustment of all regulated prices for 2005 was maintained at 6.0%. This figure results from a model of endogenous determination, which takes into account seasonal components, the exchange rate behavior, market prices inflation and the IGP change, 
e. The projection for the 6-month spread over the Selic rate, following the specification of a Vector Autoregressive model using the Selic and swap rates on the eve of the Copom meeting, starts from a -81 b.p. in the second quarter of 2004 and reaches 55 b.p. in fourth quarter of 2005. 
13. Regarding fiscal policy, it is assumed that the primary surplus target of 4.25% of the GDP for 2004 and the following two years will be achieved. The related assumptions considered in the previous meeting were maintained. 
14. Considering the hypothesis of a lower persistence of inflation, considered by the Copom since March, and the benchmark scenario hypotheses, including the maintenance of the Over-Selic rate at 16.25% p.a. and of the exchange rate close to the level prevailing on the eve of the Copom meeting (R$2.88), IPCA inflation was projected slightly below the 5.5% target for 2004 and below the 4.5% target for 2005. According to the market scenario, which takes into account the consensus exchange rate and Selic rate as surveyed by the BCB´s Investor Relations Group (Gerin) on the eve of the Copom meeting, inflation is projected above the central targets for both 2004 and 2005. 
15. The inflation registered by the IPCA decreased by the second consecutive month, to a level close to the ceiling of market expectations for the month. The pressure has been higher among market prices with a change of 0.68% and 0.69% in tradable and non-tradable items, respectively. Regulated prices fell (-0.07%) and contributed significantly to the March inflation reduction. So far, non-tradable items have contributed more intensely to inflation in 2004, with a 3.33% variation in the first quarter of 2004, while tradable and regulated items changed 1.29% and 1.03%, respectively. As a consequence of this increase to 3.33% (1Q04) from 1.19% (4Q03) in the non-tradable inflation rate, the contribution of this group to the IPCA increased 0.66 p.p. in first quarter of this year compared to the last quarter of 2003, explaining almost all inflation acceleration in 2004. Inflation measured by other national consumer indices was close to the ones observed in the IPCA. However, general price indices have shown relatively higher rates. The IGP-DI increased 0.93% in March, after increasing 0.80% and 1.08% in January and February, respectively. 
16. In contrast with the deceleration of the headline index, the various core IPCA measures calculated under the trimmed-mean method increased in March, reversing the February fall. Core inflation calculated with smoothing of pre-selected items increased to 0.76%, from 0.48%, and the core inflation calculated without the smoothing procedure rose to 0.65, from 0.28%. Core inflation calculated by excluding household food items and regulated prices decreased to 0.85% in March, from 1.00% in February. The ratio of items of the IPCA with positive variation in the month increased to 66.0%, from 60.4%, but kept within the usual range. It should be noted that increases in the measures of core inflation and inflation dispersion could be justified as a consequence of recent increases in wholesale prices, even if the pass-through remains moderate, as expected, and compatible with a favorable inflation scenario. 
17. Economic activity continues its recovery trend, despite the 1.8% fall in industrial production in February, compared to January. This fall, anticipated in the March minutes, is fully consistent with usual economic recovery cycles and is related to the sharp rebound of the second half of 2003. The recovery was fast and intense, which became clear in the new industrial output series released in April by the IBGE. According to this new series, in the second half of 2003 the industrial production was 4.2% higher than in the first half of 2003, while the old series recorded a 2.3% growth for the same period. The highest industrial production level in Brazilian history was reached in November, with a seasonally adjusted growth of 9.6%, compared to the trough observed in June. However, according to the new series, industrial production has been declining since November, in spite of signals showing a continuous economic recovery. The new series also shows a higher growth in the semi and non-durable goods sectors. While the old series indicated December 2003 as the month with the lowest output in 2003, according to the new series, there was a peak in this month, with a seasonally adjusted growth of 9.2% compared to the trough in July. 
18. Several leading and coincident indicators confirm the Copom’s evaluation regarding the positive activity trend. Packaging paper production sustained the upward trend initiated in September. Automobile production increased again in March. Average real earnings in the six metropolitan areas in the IBGE’s monthly employment survey increased in February for the second consecutive month. According to data from the CNI to Brasil and Fiesp to São Paulo, real earnings in the industry are currently in higher levels than the ones observed in 2002. Regarding Fiesp data, employment growth in the first quarter of 2004 was the highest since 1999, indicating that industrial production growth is already affecting job creation. Retail sales, according to IBGE data seasonally adjusted by the BCB, increased 2.1% in January compared to the previous month, reaching a level 6.1% higher than the same month of 2003. According to Fecomércio-SP data seasonally adjusted by the BCB, real sales in the greater São Paulo continue to increase, showing a 2.0% growth in February, compared to the previous month. Credit operations also sustained an upward trend. Despite the fall in consumer sentiment in March and April, retail sales have apparently not been affected. 
19. Brazilian external accounts continue to show very impressive positive results. The trade balance in March was 73.3% higher than in the same month of 2003, and reached US$6.2 billion in the first quarter of the year, compared to US$ 3.8 billion in the same period of 2003. Despite economic growth this year, the BCB projects a trade balance surplus similar to 2003. The current account remains positive, accumulating a US$ 1.7 billion surplus in the first quarter of 2004. The country-risk measured by the Brazil Embi+ stabilized again, after increasing in the January-February period. From the eve of the Copom meeting in March to April, the Brazil Embi+ fell to a level close to 540 b.p., from 560 b.p. The exchange rate remained almost stable, around R$2.90/US$1.00.
20. In general, the external environment remains favorable. World growth perspectives help the Brazilian trade balance. Furthermore, the anticipation of an interest rate hike in the U.S. after the disclosure of sales and consumer inflation data in March, should not change significantly costs and availability of external funding to Brazil in 2004, despite eventual turbulence in the short run. The scenario of a rise in the fed funds is already incorporated in asset prices. In addition, the remarkable adjustment in the Brazilian current account and the reduction of the FX-linked public debt contribute significantly to mitigate not only the effects of a deterioration in international liquidity to the financing of the Balance of Payments, but also its effects on the foreign exchange market. 
21. Although inflation in the first quarter was higher than expected, market expectations remained relatively stable. The small increase in expected inflation is mainly due to the incorporation of the January-March actual rates. At the end of December, according to the Gerin, inflation expectations for the first quarter of 2004 stood at 1.51%, while actual inflation reached 1.85%. The effect on expectations to 2004 was marginal, as expectations remained satisfactorily anchored. Inflation expectations for 2005 remained steady at 5.00%. Inflation expectations for the next 12 months rose slightly to 5.48%, from 5.41%, since the last Copom meeting. 
22. Copom considered BCB’s inflation projections under the hypothesis of a low degree of persistence of the first quarter inflation, following the seasonal inflation pattern observed in the last years. According to the benchmark scenario, which supposes the maintenance of the Selic rate at 16.25% p.a. and the exchange rate at R$2.88 during the forecasting horizon, inflation is slightly below the 5.5% target for 2004 and below the 4.5% target for 2005. According to the market scenario, which incorporates consensus exchange rate and Selic rate on the eve of the Copom meeting, the BCB’s projections are above the targets for 2004 and for 2005. Accumulated inflation for 2004 rose in the two scenarios because inflation was higher-than-expected in March. The market scenario projects higher inflation rates than the benchmarked scenario because it assumes a declining trend for the interest rate, as well as a small increase of the exchange rate. 
23. As the projected inflation for April in the two scenarios was very close to the one expected by the Top 5 forecasting institutions (institutions with more accurate forecasts in the short run), incorporating these expectations into projection scenarios, as recently done by Copom, does not change projected inflations for 2004 and 2005 significantly. 
24. Considering these inflation scenarios, the Committee decided, unanimously, to reduce the target for the Over-Selic rate to 16% p.a., without bias. The Committee understood that this reduction is coherent with the last meeting diagnosis, which considers more likely the benign scenario of low inflation persistence in the next months, and the low pass-through from wholesale prices to retail prices. 
25. The Copom evaluated that the cautious monetary stance has been essential to increase the likelihood of inflation converging to the target. Accordingly, inflation indicators must continue consistent with the low inflation-persistence hypothesis that has been considered. 
26. The monetary stance is different during crises periods, such as the one observed at the end of 2002 and the beginning of 2003, or during times of greater macroeconomic stability, as the one recently established. Therefore, when the crisis is reverted, as the interest rate is still considerably high, interest rate cuts are larger. However, a different interest rate dynamics should take place during times of greater macroeconomic stability, when inflation convergence to the targeted path, along with sustained economic recovery, should be monitored more carefully. 
27. The Committee stresses that it is pointless to infer that the more moderate cut of interest rate corresponds to a negative evaluation about the future behavior of inflation, or that it should cause pessimism about the future path of economic activity. On the contrary, a natural result of the progressive normalization of the economic environment is precisely the fall in the average interest rate cuts. In addition to allowing further monetary easing, this procedure enables a smooth transition to a scenario of price stability with economic growth, with smaller market interest rates volatility in the medium run. 
"
28/05/2004;96;Henrique Meirelles;"1. Consumer inflation showed a new deceleration in April. The Broad National Consumer Price Index (IPCA) rose 0.37%, compared to 0.47% in March, accumulating 2.23% in the January-April period. The IGP-DI registered a 1.15% change in April (0.93% in March), totaling a 4.02% variation in the first four months of the year. The IGP-DI rise is explained by the behavior of the Wholesale Price Index (IPA-DI), which presented a 1.57% variation in the month (1.09% in March and 4.92% accumulated until April). The accumulated IPCA variation in twelve months reached 5.26% in April, the lowest rate since the second half of 1999, at the same time as the IGP-DI and the IPA-DI stood at 5.71% and 5.14%, respectively. 
2. The lower IPCA variation was largely caused by the turnaround in food prices, which registered a 0.34% decline in April, compared to a 0.43% increase in March. This reversal reflected the supply increase due to the harvest period. 
3. The main individual contribution for the 0.37% IPCA change stemmed from medicine prices (a 3.0% rise), partly capturing the 5.7% average readjustment granted by the Regulation Chamber to certain controlled products. Among other pressures, electricity prices, pasteurized milk, clothes and bottled cooking gas were the main contributors for the IPCA change. In contrast, among items with price decreases, the most important ones were meat, gasoline, fuel alcohol and rice. 
4. Further to the IPCA in April, market prices increased 0.39% (0.69% in March), accounting for 0.28 percentage points of the monthly IPCA rate, while the 0.32% variation in regulated prices contributed for the remaining 0.09 percentage points. After a 0.82% variation in March, market prices excluding food presented a 0.75% change in April, showing that deceleration in market prices’ increases occurred mainly due to food prices. Concerning regulated prices, the most significant contribution came from the rise of electricity prices in six state capitals and urban buses fares in Curitiba and Porto Alegre, besides the increase of bottled cooking gas prices. These increases prevailed over the negative variations in the prices of fuel alcohol and gasoline, though in lower magnitude than the contribution registered in March. 
5. The increase in wholesale prices, as captured by the IPA-DI, was a result of higher pressures from industrial prices (a 1.86% rise in April, compared to 0.94% in March), once there was a deceleration in agricultural prices, from 1.48% in March to 0.8% in April. Increasing commodity prices were the main cause of pressure on industrial wholesale prices. Fuel, sugar, medicine and agricultural machinery presented the highest price changes. 
6. All measures of IPCA core inflation declined in April. The core calculated excluding household food items and regulated prices posted a 0.72% change (0.85% in March), accumulating 7.0% in twelve months. 
7. IPCA core inflation calculated by the smoothed trimmed-mean method decreased to 0.57% in April from 0.76% in March, totaling 8.90% in the last twelve months. Without the smoothing procedure for pre-selected items, the IPCA core reached 0.45% in the month and 5.68% in the last twelve months, compared to 0.65% and 6.11%, respectively, in March. 
8. IPC-Br core inflation, calculated by the Getúlio Vargas Foundation (FGV) using the symmetric trimmed-mean method, stood at 0.53% in April, the same change recorded in March, accruing 7.15% in twelve months. 
9. In May, consumer inflation should still be affected by medicine, health insurance and clothes prices, as well as by the adjustment in electricity prices in various state capitals and the recovery of fuel alcohol prices. Moreover, an unexpected turnaround in the downward trend of food prices has been noticed in the first weeks of the month, as shown in the partial IPC-S and IPC-Fipe results. 
10. The identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to new available information. The scenario considered in the simulations assumes the following hypotheses: 
a. The projections for the evolution of gasoline and bottled cooking gas prices in 2004 were maintained at 9.5% and 6.9%, respectively, 
b. The projections for household electricity prices increased to 11%. For fixed telephone prices, the Copom maintained the adjustment estimate at 6.7% for the year, 
c. Regarding all regulated prices, with a total weight of 28.6% in the April IPCA, a 7.7% rise is projected, 0.3 p.p. above the projection made in the previous meeting, 
d. The projection for the readjustment of all regulated prices for 2005 was maintained at 6.0%. This figure is endogenously determined, taking into account seasonal components, the exchange rate, market prices inflation and the IGP-DI change, 
e. The projection for the 6-month spread over the Selic rate, following the specification of a Vector Autoregressive model based on the Selic and the swap rates on the eve of the Copom meeting, increases from -38 basis points in the second quarter of 2004 to 59 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2005. 
11. Regarding fiscal policy, it is assumed that the consolidated public sector primary surplus target of 4.25% of the GDP for 2004 and the following two years will be achieved. The related assumptions considered in the previous meeting were maintained. 
12. Considering the benchmark scenario hypotheses - the Over-Selic rate at 16.0% p.a. and the exchange rate at the level seen on the eve of the Copom meeting (R$3.10), and also considering the hypothesis of a lower degree of inflation persistence, as assumed by the Copom since March, IPCA inflation was projected slightly above the 5.5% target for 2004 and below the 4.5% target for 2005. According to the market scenario, which takes into account the consensus exchange rate and Selic rate as surveyed by the BCB´s Investor Relations Group (Gerin) on the eve of the Copom meeting, inflation is projected above the central targets for both 2004 and 2005. 
13. The inflation measured by the IPCA decreased in April for the third month in a row. As in recent months, market prices inflation has been higher than regulated prices inflation (0,39% compared to 0.32%). Amongst market prices, for the first time since October 2003, tradable goods inflation (0.50%) was higher than non-tradable goods inflation (0.25%). However, for the year to April, non-tradable goods prices increased 3.59% and were the ones that most contributed to the 2.23% IPCA inflation. Prices of tradable goods rose 1.80% in the period, while regulated prices rose 1.35%. In April, other national consumer inflation measures registered inflation similar to the IPCA, such as the Consumer Price Index – Domestic Supply (IPC-DI). However, general price indices have recorded higher rates. The IGP-DI increased 1.15% in April, accumulating a 4.02% increase in the year. Industrial wholesale inflation has continued to increase, though the pass-through to consumer inflation has remained lower than usual. 
14. Core consumer inflation in April also declined compared to March. The smoothed trimmed-mean core fell to 0.57% in April from 0.76% in March. The non-smoothed trimmed-mean core declined to 0.45% in April from 0.65% in March. Core inflation excluding household food items and regulated prices still posted a high rate (0.72%), albeit lower than the previous month (0.85%). 
15. Certainly, the April’s IPCA result does not imply that inflation is accommodating at a lower level. Still, it is an evidence of the seasonal relief that had already been incorporated to the Copom’s forecasting exercises. The IPCA behavior has been consistent with the Copom´s assessment and projections, under a hypothesis of low inflation persistence in the first quarter of the year. 
16. Economic activity has sustained the recovery trend since the second half of 2003, as confirmed by several indicators. Industrial production increased 2.1% in March compared to February, seasonally adjusted. In comparison with the first quarter of 2003, industrial output grew 5.8%, led by capital and durable goods. According to the industrial survey, all regions showed a positive performance, except Rio de Janeiro. Industrial sales remained strong throughout the quarter and inventories diminished, in line with the results of the FGV industrial survey, in which only 7% of the firms recorded excessive inventories in the first quarter of the year, compared to 10% in the previous quarter and 12% in the first quarter of 2003. 
17. According to IBGE data, seasonally adjusted by the BCB, retail sales have maintained an uninterrupted growth trend since March 2003. In March 2004, retail sales reached the highest level in the last two years, up 1.1% in comparison to February. Sales in the first quarter increased 3.3% compared to the last quarter of 2003, seasonally adjusted. The improvement in activity can also be depicted from the Fecomercio-SP consumer sentiment survey. Consumer confidence improved in May to a level similar to January and February – the highest since the survey began, in March 1999. 
18. Labor market indicators, which usually react with a lag in recovery cycles, have also improved. According to data from Cadastro Geral de Empregados e Desempregados (Caged) of the Ministry of Labor and Employment, the average formal employment between January and April stood 3.5% above the same period of last year. In the first four months of 2004, 535 thousand jobs were created, the best performance since 1995. For comparison, during last year 645 thousand jobs were created. The National Industry Confederation (CNI) and the Federation of Industries of the State of São Paulo (Fiesp) data for employment and industrial wages in March also grew, compared to February. Similarly, industrial employment data published by the IBGE show an employment expansion of 0.4% in March and 0.9% in the first quarter (s.a.), while worked hours grew 1.5% in the quarter. According to the IBGE survey, industrial wages increased 9.3% in the first quarter of 2004, year-on-year, while CNI estimated a 6.6% increase. 
19. It is important to notice that the activity rebound continued during the first quarter of 2004, despite the widespread apprehension that the Copom’s decision to keep unchanged the Over-Selic rate in January and February could have halted the process. Such concerns were probably enhanced by the negative industrial output figures for January and February. However, variables directly linked to demand, such as retail and industrial sales, together with industrial output for March, confirmed that the recovery process had not lost momentum. Several indicators released since then have indicated that the expectational effects of the Copom decision in January and February, as anticipated by the Committee, were successful in influencing the inflation dynamics in the short-run, without damaging the cyclical rebound that was already spread out. 
20. Brazilian external accounts have continued posting expressive positive results. In April, the trade balance reached US$2.0 billion, totaling US$ 8.1 billion in the year, compared to US$5.5 billion in the same period of 2003. The Central Bank estimates a 2004 trade surplus similar to 2003. The current account accumulated a US$0.9 billion surplus in 2004, despite a negative result in April, a consequence of Brady bonds interest payments. The improvement in both the trade balance and the current account has continued reflecting exports growth (25% in the first four months of the year), regardless of the imports increase (18%). First quarter data indicate that exports growth is mainly a result of higher quantities. 
21. The most meaningful alteration in the economic environment since the April Copom meeting has occurred in the external scenario, due to the change in market sentiment regarding the US monetary policy and the increase in oil prices. Although some reallocation of investment portfolios had already been anticipated, the move was more abrupt than expected. The short-term instability impacted several currencies, as well as emerging markets risk premiums. From April to May Copom meetings, the exchange rate depreciated to R$3.10 from R$2.89 per US dollar, and the country-risk measured by the JP Morgan Embi+ increased to 728 basis points from 543 basis points. However, this greater instability does not characterize a crisis, due to both its temporary nature and the sound fundaments of the Brazilian economy. 
22. Brazil is in a much better situation to react to external events than it was in the past, given the substantial fiscal and external adjustments it has achieved. The Brazilian government has been giving solid proof of fiscal responsibility, as noted in the recent decision about the minimum wage readjustment. Moreover, economic activity indicators, including the ones referring to the labor market, have been providing unquestionable evidence of the Brazilian sustained economic recovery, diminishing concerns that have fuelled volatility in the last weeks. 
23. Since the last Copom meeting, crude oil prices have exacerbated the upward trend that had already been observed beforehand. If this trend results from higher demand perspectives, and not from exogenous supply constraints, it will find natural limits in its own effects over the world economic growth. Given the recent record levels, the most likely scenario for the next months is some accommodation in prices. The Copom has been explicitly including in its projections an increase in domestic gasoline prices. Specifically, Copom’s scenarios incorporate a 9.5% increase in gasoline prices in 2004, which would translate into an increase of 11.8% during the remaining of the year, considering the prices’ fall since January. If oil prices remain high in the medium-term, characterizing a supply shock of a more permanent fashion, it will be necessary to revaluate this projection and its likely primary and secondary inflationary impacts. 
24. In addition to the increase in oil prices and to the uncertainty related to the US monetary stance, there has been a certain concern regarding the possibility of a slowdown in China, a country responsible for a significant share of Brazilian exports growth. In the last twelve months, exports to China represented around 6% of total Brazilian exports. Exports to China increased US$381 million in 2004, equivalent to 7% of the exports increase this year. Regarding the magnitude of the expected deceleration of the Chinese economy (to around 7.0% from 9.5%), the direct effect on Brazilian exports does not seem to be strong. There are also indirect effects, due to the reduction of Brazilian exports prices. However, it is important to notice that export prices increases have accounted for just 25% of exports expansion in the last twelve months to March. In other words, prices explain just US$3.5 billion out of the US$14 billion exports growth. Thus, there are reasons to believe that the Brazilian exports performance won’t be strongly affected by a possible reduction in the pace of the Chinese economic growth. 
25. Market inflation expectations increased, reflecting an environment of greater uncertainty. However, the increase was small and expectations remained properly anchored. The median of inflation expectations for 2004 reached 6.22% on the eve of the meeting, compared to 6.00% at the end of December. For the first time this year, 2005 inflation expectations increased, to 5.06% from 5.00%. The median of inflation expectations for the next 12 months increased to 5.67% from 5.48%, between the eves of the last two Copom meetings. 
26. As in previous meetings, the Copom examined chiefly the inflation outlook under the hypothesis of a low degree of persistence of the first quarter inflation. This hypothesis is based on a seasonal relief in market prices inflation in the second and third quarters, as observed in previous years. Inflation projections in the benchmark scenario, based on an unchanged Over-Selic rate at 16.0% and the exchange rate at R$3.10 throughout the projection horizon, point out to an inflation rate slightly above the target of 5.5% for 2004 and below the 4.5% target for 2005. In relation to April, there was an increase in the 2004 inflation projection, mainly caused by a more depreciated exchange rate. In the market scenario, which takes into account the exchange rate and Over-Selic rate expected by the market on the eve of the Copom meeting, inflation projections remain above the targets for 2004 and 2005. In fact, for 2004 inflation projections for the benchmark and for the market scenarios are close to each other, because, if on the one hand, interest rates are lower in the market scenario, on the other hand, the exchange rate is also more appreciated. For 2005, the market scenario projects higher inflation than the benchmark one, because the former supposes a declining interest rate path and a slightly depreciated exchange rate. 
27. The Copom also analyzed the inflation projections for the next 12 months, corresponding to the second half of 2004 and the first half of 2005. This is a period when inflation outcomes will be more sensitive to monetary policy decisions taken in the next months, and at the same time, it presents more reliable inflation projections than the ones already available for 2005. The projected inflation for this 12-month period, on both the benchmark and market scenarios, remains within the central targets established by the National Monetary Council for 2004 and 2005. 
28. Although the recent realignments in the exchange rate and in oil prices may have a long-lasting component, the Copom members were unanimous in considering that the Brazilian economy, due to the soundness of its fundaments, is in a position to absorb this external shock without damaging the macroeconomic stability and growth perspectives. The significant adjustment of the current account, the reduction of the FX-linked debt, the adjustment of the consolidated public sector accounts, the combination of floating exchange rate with inflation targeting, the economic activity rebound in the last quarters and the credibility gains in macroeconomic management help to absorb the consequences of the external shock. 
29. Even in less favorable scenarios than the most likely ones analyzed by the Copom, it is possible to be optimistic about economic growth with price stability prospects in the medium-term. Considering that oil prices and the exchange rate remain unchanged, and assuming the maintenance of the Over-Selic rate at 16.0%, the Copom forecasts an inflation rate closer to the target (5.5%) than to the upper limit of the tolerance interval (8.0%) for 2004. The same forecast indicates a convergence of inflation to the target of 4.5% in 2005. Therefore, considering this less likely hypothesis, the flexibility of the inflation targeting regime, when cautiously used, would avoid high costs in terms of inflationary acceleration. 
30. In an inflation targeting regime, the Central Bank policy-making is based on the assessment of different scenarios for the most important variables affecting inflation dynamics. The uncertainties about the external scenario have been responsible for a short-term volatility that increased the uncertainty about future inflation behavior. As a consequence, both the assessment of alternative scenarios by the monetary authority and the coordination of private agent's expectations become more difficult. In this environment, the volatility triggered by risk factors that should not prevail in the medium-term, when the external scenario will be cleared, could affect inflation expectations for a longer period. 
31. Three members of the Copom considered relatively low the risk of a contagion of inflation expectations by the short-term volatility and voted for a decrease of 25 basis points in the Over-Selic rate. However, six members considered that this risk could increase substantially if the monetary policy did not take into account the even remote possibility that some changes in the external scenario might be permanent. In addition, the majority judged that, as the uncertainties in the projection scenarios increased significantly, the best policy to be adopted is the one usually taken by Central Banks in similar circumstances: not to change the monetary instruments as much as they could be in a situation without this additional uncertainty. Therefore, these six members understood that the most adequate decision would be to keep the Over-Selic rate unchanged.

25/06/2004;97;Henrique Meirelles;"1. In May, the main inflation indicators increased, mainly due to specific pressures on fresh food prices, harshly affected by climate adversities. The Broad National Consumer Price Index (IPCA) rose 0.51%, compared to a 0.37% increase in April, accumulating a 2.75% change in the year up to May. The IPCA change in the last twelve months stood at 5.15%, the lowest variation since the adoption of the inflation-targeting regime in 1999. 
2. The General Price Index (IGP-DI) rose by 1.46% in May, compared to 1.15% in April, totaling a 5.54% change in the first five months of 2004. The IGP-DI acceleration was due not only to wholesale-prices inflation (1.71%), but also to stronger pressures from consumer prices (0.71%) and construction industry costs (1.83%). The variation of the IGP-DI and of the Wholesale Price Index (IPA-DI) in the last twelve months to May stood at 7.97% and 8.76%, respectively. 
3. In May, the IPCA upsurge primarily reflected the turnaround in food prices, which increased 0.23% from a negative 0.34% in April. Climate adversities and the milk inter-harvest period explain this shift. Food-prices inflation was not generalized, as important products (manioc flour, meat, bean, rice, eggs, chicken, fish and soy oil) registered price falls. 
4. For the second consecutive month, medicine was the main individual contributor to the IPCA inflation (0.10 p.p.), reflecting the readjustments authorized by the sector's Regulation Chamber. Energy and vehicles contributed each with 0.06 p.p., while pasteurized milk and clothes contributed with 0.05 p.p. each. Together, these five items accounted for 0.32 p.p. of the 0.51% IPCA change. 
5. Market prices increased 0.57%, compared to 0.39% in April. Excluding food, these prices increased 0.74% as against 0.75% in April. Regulated prices rose by 0.35% (0.32% in April), impacted by the increase in energy prices in six State capitals and in fuel-alcohol prices, which recovered from a sharp reduction from January to April. Market prices accounted for 0.41 p.p. of the monthly IPCA, while regulated prices contributed with the residual 0.10 p.p. 
6. The IPA-DI registered a 1.71% variation in May, from 1.57% in April. The accelerating trend resulted from the increase in the agriculture IPA, which rose to 2.71% in the month, compared to 0.8% in April, mainly influenced by the prices of fresh food products, meat and chicken. The industrial IPA decreased to 1.32%, compared to 1.86% in April. 
7. Core inflation measures remained relatively stable in May, compared to April. The IPCA core inflation calculated by excluding household food items and regulated prices posted a 0.70% change (0.72% in April), accumulating 7.15% in the last twelve months. When calculated under the smoothed trimmed-mean method, the core increased to 0.59% (0.57% in April), totaling 8.46% in twelve months. Without the smoothing procedure for pre-selected items, the IPCA core recorded 0.43% in the month and 5.46% in twelve months, compared to 0.45% and 5.68%, respectively, in April. 
8. The IPC-Br core inflation measure, calculated by the Getúlio Vargas Foundation (FGV) under the symmetric trimmed-mean method, stood at 0.57% in May, accumulating 6.64% in 12 months. 
9. In June, inflation should be influenced by the increase in the prices of gasoline (the readjustment to consumers, effective since June 15th, is expected to average 4.5%) and of fuel-alcohol, still recovering from the significant price decrease that took place from February to April. Food prices are also expected to continue affecting inflation, especially meat and dairy products, due to the beginning of the inter-harvest period. As to the wholesale, besides the agricultural price pressures, some deceleration in the industrial price variation is expected, apart from fuel. 
10. The identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to new available information. The scenario considered in the simulations assumes the following hypotheses: 
a. The projections for the evolution of gasoline and bottled cooking gas prices in 2004 were maintained at 9.5% and 6.9%, respectively, 
b. The projections for household electricity prices were maintained at 11% for 2004. Yet, for fixed telephone prices, the Copom revised the adjustment estimate to 6.1% for the year, 0.6 p.p. lower than in the previous meeting, 
c. Regarding all regulated prices, with a total weight of 28.6% in the May IPCA, a 7.7% rise is projected, the same as in the previous meeting, 
d. The projection for the readjustment of all regulated prices for 2005, following the model of endogenous determination, which takes into account seasonal components, the exchange rate, market prices inflation and the IGP-DI change, was maintained at 6.0%, 
e. The projection for the 6-month spread over the Selic rate, following the specification of a Vector Autoregressive model based on the Selic and the swap rates on the eve of the Copom meeting, increases from 39 basis points in the second quarter of 2004 to 60 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2005. 
11. Regarding fiscal policy, it is assumed that the consolidated public sector primary surplus target of 4.25% of the GDP for 2004 and the following two years will be achieved. The related assumptions considered in the previous meeting were maintained. 
12. Considering the benchmark scenario hypotheses, including the maintenance of the Over-Selic rate at 16.0% p.a. and the exchange rate at the level observed on the eve of the Copom meeting (R$3.10), the IPCA inflation was projected above the 5.5% target for 2004 and below the 4.5% target for 2005. According to the market scenario, which takes into account the consensus exchange rate and Over-Selic rate as surveyed by the BCB´s Investor Relations Group (Gerin) on the eve of the Copom meeting, inflation is projected above the central targets for both 2004 and 2005. 
13. In May, the IPCA inflation edged up in comparison to April but it did not deviate from market consensus. Similar to previous months, the strongest pressure stemmed from market prices. For the second consecutive month, tradable prices presented a higher increase than non-tradable prices. An unusual feature was the unfavorable trend in food prices. Other national consumer-price indices also edged up in May, like the IPC-DI (up 0.71% from 0.31% in April). Wholesale inflation also increased but, contrary to previous months, the main pressure stemmed from agriculture prices, while industrial prices changes decelerated. The pass-through of wholesale prices to consumer prices remains below usual. Wholesale-industrial prices should continue to decelerate due to the recent trend of commodity prices. Agriculture prices, however, represent an important source of pressure over inflation in the short run, larger than the seasonal pattern at this time of the year. 
14. In May, IPCA core measures remained relatively stable compared to April. Core inflation calculated under the trimmed-mean method, with and without the smoothing procedure of pre-selected items, rose by 0.59% and 0.43%, respectively. Core inflation excluding food items and regulated prices stood at 0.70%. In the year to May, the cores calculated under the trimmed-mean methods continued close to the headline inflation (with and without smoothing changed 3.19% and 2.46%, respectively), differently from the core by exclusion, which rose by 3.97%. 
15. Recent economic activity indicators confirm, undoubtedly, the continuity of the economic rebound process initiated in the second quarter of 2003. The recovery trend was corroborated by the GDP figures for the first quarter of 2004. Real GDP grew 1.6% quarter-on-quarter, seasonally adjusted. In comparison with the same quarter of 2003, real GDP rose by 2.7%. In order to achieve the 3.5% estimated growth rate for the year, it is necessary for the GDP to grow on average 0.5% per quarter during the next three quarters. In an extremely unrealistic scenario in which the seasonally adjusted GDP remains flat in the next three quarters, the 2004 GDP would grow 2.8%. 
16. The industrial production levels of March were maintained in April, while growth prospects remained favorable. Industrial production grew 0.1% month-on-month in April, seasonally adjusted, accumulating a 6.1% growth in the year, compared to the same period of 2003. Capital goods (up 21.4%) and durable consumer goods (up 21.1%) are the categories leading the industrial growth cycle. According to CNI data, seasonally adjusted by the BCB, real industrial sales grew 3.7% month-on-month in April, confirming the growth trend initiated in the second half of 2003. 
17. In April, retail sales sustained the growth pace, reaching the highest levels since the IBGE initiated the retail survey in January 2000. Sales grew 1.8% compared to March, adding to a 5.4% increase in the November-April period compared to the previous six months. Consumer confidence measured by the Federação do Comércio do Estado de São Paulo (Fecomercio SP) fell in June, but the average index for the first semester is still 6.8% higher than the level registered in the same period of the previous year. Credit operations continued to expand for both individuals and companies, despite the fall of non-earmarked credit concessions in May. Several other coincident and leading indicators reinforce the perception of a continued economic recovery, such as packaging paper shipments, which grew 8.4% in the first five months of the year compared to the same period of 2003. 
18. Even though the exports have been playing an important role to economic activity rebound, as a consequence of the significant adjustment of the external accounts, domestic demand has been increasing its relative importance to the sustained economic growth. This importance tends to broaden as the recovery of employment and real payroll lead to higher consumption. In April, employment in the manufacturing sector increased, while real payroll registered a slight decrease, although it kept in an upward trend. There are three reasons why employment growth has not yet reduced the unemployment rate. Firstly, this period of the year is usually characterized by a seasonal increase in the unemployment rate, independently on the economic cycle. Secondly, the recovery process has stimulated workers to search for jobs, even those who had not been searching for occupation for some time. As a consequence, labor force increases causing the unemployment rate to rise. Lastly, the unemployment rate is calculated in the largest urban areas, where employment growth has been not as strong as in medium and small urban areas, as well as in the rural areas. According to the Ministry of Labor and Employment, the level of formal employment in the first four months of the year increased 3.2% in the metropolitan regions and 3.8% out of those regions, both compared to the same period of 2003. 
19. Brazilian external accounts have continued to register expressive positive results. Despite the increase in imports, the trade balance posted a US$3.1 billion surplus in May, a historical record. The BCB's revised upwards its trade balance estimate for the year to US$ 26 billion from US$24 billion. The current account balance has remained positive, accumulating a US$2.4 billion surplus in the year up to May, close to the estimated surplus for the whole year. 
20. The external scenario has somewhat stabilized since the last Copom meeting, even though the high volatility environment has persisted. Although tension in the oil market has lessened, there are still uncertainties regarding the expected path of the fed funds rate in the U.S. The exchange rate has remained slightly above R$3.10/US$, and its 21-day volatility reached the highest level since May 2003. The country risk measured by the JP Morgan Chase’s Embi+ decreased from 728 b.p. in the period immediately before the last Copom meeting to 670 b.p. on the eve of this meeting. 
21. Since the last Copom meeting, oil prices have fallen approximately 11%, following the OPEC decision to increase output. The 10.8% wholesale readjustment in gasoline prices announced by Petrobrás on June 15 stood close to the figures expected by the Committee, and partially closed the gap between internal and external prices. 
22. Market inflation expectations deserved special attention by the members of the Copom. The deterioration observed since the last meeting was not limited to 2004 IPCA expectations (the median rose to 6.71% from 6.22%), but also affected longer-terms expectations: for the next twelve months, the median projection increased to 6.03% from 5.67%, while for 2005, the median, that was anchored around 5%, moved up to 5.44%. In a scenario of temporary shocks affecting the inflation path, it would be more reasonable to observe a sharper deterioration in inflation expectations in shorter horizons, when the first order effects are concentrated and monetary policy effectiveness is limited. The Committee members share the conviction that the magnitude of the deterioration observed for longer horizons is not compatible with the view that, in the presence of eventual supply shocks of a more permanent nature, the monetary policy will not accommodate its secondary effects. Such deterioration is also not compatible with the inflation forecasts produced by the different models used by the Copom, even if these projections take into account particularly unfavorable scenarios to the evolution of the main determinants of the recent shocks. 
23. Since the meeting in April, the Copom has assessed inflation prospects based on the assumption of a low degree of persistence of the first quarter inflation, as observed in previous years when there was a seasonal relief in market prices inflation in the second and third quarters. Considering the inflation in April and May, and the non-usual increase of market-prices inflation in May, the Copom assessed with greater emphasis the inflation projections made without the assumption of low persistence. Inflation projections in the benchmark scenario, based on an unchanged Over-Selic rate at 16.0% and the exchange rate at R$3.10/US$ throughout the projection horizon, point out to an inflation rate above the target of 5.5% for 2004 and below the target of 4.5% for 2005. In the market scenario, which takes into account the exchange rate and Over-Selic rate expected by the market on the eve of the Copom meeting, inflation projections remain above the targets for 2004 and 2005. Compared to May, there was a slight increase in the projections for 2004 in both scenarios, basically caused by the higher inflation expectations for 2004 and 2005. 
24. As in the previous meeting, the Copom also considered the inflation projections for the next 12 months, corresponding to the second half of 2004 and the first half of 2005. This is a period when inflation outcomes will be more sensitive to monetary decisions taken in the next few months, and at the same time, it presents more reliable inflation projections than the ones already available for 2005. Projected inflation for this 12-month period, on both the benchmark and market scenarios, remains within the central targets established by the National Monetary Council for 2004 and 2005. 
25. In an inflation-targeting regime, the Central Bank policy-making process is based on the assessment of different scenarios for the most important variables affecting inflation dynamics. The current uncertainties concerning the external scenario have been responsible for a short-term volatility that tends to increase inflation uncertainty. As a consequence, the coordination of private agent's inflation expectations became more difficult. The inflation rate increase in the short-term, caused by either seasonal factors or financial assets prices volatility, should not contaminate private expectations for longer periods. Like in the previous meeting, the Committee assessed that the macroeconomics perspectives for the medium-term are still favorable. In the short-term, however, inflation expectations have become a relatively more important risk factor than in the last month. 
26. Even considering less favorable scenarios, the Copom is still optimistic about the achievement of economic growth with price stability. Considering the hypothesis that important external variables continue under pressure for a longer period, the flexibility of the inflation-targeting regime could judiciously absorb the primary shocks associated with this pressure. However, it would be paramount for monetary policy to fight the second order effects of these shocks. In this case, economic activity could benefit from the progressive recovery of real earnings, which depends on a price stability environment in the medium-term.

29/07/2004;98;Henrique Meirelles;"1. In June, the Broad National Consumer Price Index (IPCA) rose 0.71%, up from 0.51% in May, accumulating a 3.48% change in the first half of the year, and a 6.06% variation in twelve months. The monthly IPCA acceleration in June was mainly due to the increase in the prices of fuel and food. 
2. The General Price Index (IGP-DI) rose 1.29% in June, compared to 1.46% in May, accumulating a 6.90% change in the first half of 2004. In June, the deceleration of the IGP-DI was a consequence of a lower increase in wholesale prices and in construction industry costs, while consumer-price inflation registered a slight increase. The Wholesale Price Index (IPA-DI) rose by 1.57% in the month and 8.38% in the first half of the year. Regarding 12-month rates, the IGP-DI and IPA-DI reached 10.13% and 11.76% in June, respectively. 
3. The main individual contributor to the IPCA inflation was gasoline (0.14 p.p.), reflecting the pass-through to consumers of the gasoline price increase by distributors on June 15 (10.8%), and the 11.35% surge in alcohol-based fuel prices. As a consequence, transportation prices increased 1.58% in June, contributing with 0.33 p.p. to the monthly IPCA change. 
4. Food prices rose 0.72% and accounted for 0.17 p.p. of the June IPCA change. Climate adversities affected the supply of some products such as onions, tomatoes and vegetables. The inter-harvest period was responsible for the increase in the prices of milk and dairy products, such as cheese, yogurt and powdered milk. 
5. Market prices increased 0.58%, compared to 0.57% in May, accounting for 0.42 p.p. of the monthly IPCA, while the increase of 1.03% in regulated prices was responsible for the remaining 0.29 p.p. The relative stability in market prices inflation was a consequence of the deceleration in non-food prices, which attenuated the impact of the acceleration in food prices. Concerning regulated prices, urban and interstate transport fares contributed to the surge, together with gasoline and alcohol-fuel prices. 
6. In June, the IPA-DI grew 1.57% (1.71% in May). This reduction was a consequence of the deceleration of agriculture wholesale inflation, which rose 0.52% in June compared to 2.71% in May. In the same period, industrial wholesale inflation increased to 1.97% from 1.32%, mainly pressured by the price readjustment of fuel and fertilizers, which caused an increase of 5.37% in chemical prices, compared to 1.72% in May. 
7. The IPCA core inflation, calculated by excluding household food items and regulated prices, registered a 0.53% variation in June (0.70% in May), accumulating 7.17% in 12 months. 
8. The IPCA core inflation, calculated under the smoothed trimmed-mean method, increased to 0.60% in June from 0.59% in May, totaling 8.16% in the last 12 months to June. Without the smoothing procedure for pre-selected items, the core IPCA recorded 0.48% in June and 5.56% in twelve months, compared to 0.43% and 5.46% rates in May. 
9. The Consumer Price Inflation - Brazil (IPC-Br) core, calculated by the Getúlio Vargas Foundation (FGV) under the symmetric trimmed-mean method, stood at 0.50% in June, compared to 0.57% in May, accumulating 6.39% in the last twelve months. 
10. In July, consumer inflation should be affected by the readjustment in regulated prices (electricity, gasoline, alcohol-fuel, fixed telephone and urban bus in Rio de Janeiro). Among market prices, food is expected to continue affecting inflation, especially meat and dairy products, still pressured by the inter-harvest period. Moreover, due to seasonal reasons, school vacation time is expected to raise entertainment prices. Regarding wholesale inflation, pressures over the prices of animals and by-products, fuels and fertilizers are expected to continue. These pressures should be partially offset by the deceleration of other industrial prices. 
11. The identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to new available information. The scenario considered in the simulations assumes the following hypotheses: 
a. The Copom's projection for the increase of oil prices in 2004 was maintained at 9.5%. The projection for the increase of cooking gas prices was slightly reduced to 6.8% from 6.9%, 
b. The projections for the readjustment of household electricity prices in 2004 increased to 11.6% from 11.0% in the previous Copom meeting. Regarding fixed telephone services, the Copom revised its estimate for the annual adjustment to 12.8% from 6.1%. This revision follows the Supreme Judicial Court decision to reinstate the IGP-DI index instead of the IPCA index for purposes of the annual adjustment in 2003, overturning a lower court ruling, 
c. Regarding all regulated prices, with a total weight of 28.6% in the June IPCA, a 8.3% rise is projected, 0.6 p.p. above the projection made in the previous meeting, 
d. The projection for the readjustment of all regulated prices for 2005, following the model of endogenous determination, which takes into account seasonal components, the exchange rate, market prices inflation and the IGP-DI change, was maintained at 6.0%, 
e. The projection for the 6-month spread over the Selic rate, following the specification of a Vector Autoregressive model based on the Selic and the swap rates on the eve of the Copom meeting, increases from 51 basis points in the second quarter of 2004 to 58 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2005. 
12. Regarding fiscal policy, it is assumed that the consolidated public sector primary surplus target of 4.25% of the GDP for 2004 and the following two years will be achieved. The related assumptions considered in the previous meeting were maintained. 
13. Considering the benchmark scenario hypotheses, including the maintenance of the Over-Selic interest rate at 16.0% p.a. and of the exchange rate close to the level prevailing on the eve of the Copom meeting (R$3.00), IPCA inflation was projected above the 5.5% target for 2004 and slightly above the 4.5% target for 2005. According to the market scenario, which takes into consideration the consensus Over-Selic rate and exchange rate as surveyed by the BCB’s Investor Relations Group - Gerin on the eve of the Copom meeting, inflation is projected above the targets for both 2004 and 2005. 
14. In June, market prices inflation registered the highest rate for the month in the last several years. From February to May, market prices increased systematically above regulated prices, accumulating 2.42% against 0.86% of the regulated. In June, however, inflation was pressured not only by market prices (up 0.58%) but also by regulated prices (up 1.03%, partly due to the rise in gasoline prices), thus resulting in the 0.71% IPCA variation for the month. In the first half of the year, market prices surged 3.77%, equivalent to a 7.69% annualized rate. Other nationwide consumer-inflation indices also posted high changes in the last two months, as in the case of the IPC-DI (0.71% and 0.78% in May and June, respectively). The IPA-DI has also recorded high changes throughout this year, mainly pressured by industrial prices, up 9.96% in the January to June period. 
15. IPCA trimmed-mean core measures have stood relatively stable in the past few months, albeit at figures incompatible with the medium-term inflation targets. In the first half of the year, the smoothed and non-smoothed trimmed-mean cores posted 3.79% and 2.96%, respectively, or annual figures of 7.72% and 6.00%, respectively. Core inflation excluding household food items and regulated prices stood at 4.52% in the same period (9.24% in annual terms), well above the 3.48% headline inflation. 
16. Economic activity has continued to present a vigorous growth rate, outstripping every month the growth rate projected at the end of 2003. Several leading and coincident indicators anticipate continuous growth for the near future. For instance, packaging paper shipments, which have been growing since the second half of 2003, rose 1.5% in June compared to May (data from the Corrugated Paperboard Association - ABPO, seasonally adjusted by the BCB). 
17. In May, industrial production posted a historical high, overcoming the previous peak of November 2003. Industrial production grew 2.2% month-on-month, seasonally adjusted, and 7.8% compared to May 2003, the eighth consecutive positive year-on-year rate. In the January-May period, industrial output increased 6.5% compared to the same period of last year. Real industrial sales increased 3.0% in May compared to April, reaching the highest figure ever recorded for the series, which began to be released in December 1991 (data from the National Industry Confederation - CNI, seasonally adjusted by the BCB). 
18. Retail sales have also kept its growth trend initiated in the second half of 2003. Similarly to the industrial output, sales have also overcome historical records. After reaching the highest figure for the index in April, sales grew 0.7% month-on-month in May, seasonally adjusted, a 10.0% increase compared to the same month of the previous year. Sales expansion comprises almost all retail sectors, not only the ones more credit-sensitive but also the ones that respond to the evolution of real earnings. In July, consumer confidence measured by the Federação do Comércio do Estado de São Paulo (Fecomercio-SP) increased 4.9% compared to June. 
19. The economic activity rebound has caused an increase in the manufacturing industry level of capacity utilization, which reached record highs for the recent years. According to data seasonally adjusted by the BCB, the quarterly FGV industrial survey reported a capacity utilization of 81.9% in April (the highest rate in the last three years), while the monthly CNI survey recorded 81.8% in May (the second highest level of the series since December 1991). The marginal production growth deserves special attention, considering that it has been increasing continuously for the last months, suggesting a faster occupation of the existing idle capacity. 
20. Conversely, capital goods sector has presented the highest growth rates amongst the industrial sectors. In the year up to May, capital goods output grew 22.5% compared the same period of 2003. Capital goods absorption (domestic production plus net imports) grew 11.4% in the same period. In such an environment, which combines fast demand growth with the recovery of fixed capital investment, the estimate of the output gap, crucial to evaluate inflationary pressures, becomes more uncertain. As stressed in the June Inflation Report, there is strong evidence that the capacity utilization is heterogeneously distributed among the different productive sectors, making it important to maintain a favorable environment for fixed capital investment, mainly on those sectors with lower idle capacity, thus enabling output to increase without causing inflationary pressures. 
21. Although external demand has played a paramount role to the initial cyclical rebound, domestic demand has been increasingly important. This is not unexpected, considering the relatively small share of the external sector on the Brazilian GDP. There are two major factors behind the increase in domestic demand: credit expansion and the recovery of the labor market. According to data produced by CNI, seasonally adjusted by the BCB, employment in the manufacturing sector, after recording in February the highest level of the series since the end of 1998, still presented continuous growth in the following three months (0.3% in May, compared to April). A similar trend has also been observed for real payroll, which attained levels equivalent to those verified in the first half of 2001. In June, according to the Ministry of Labor and Employment, formal employment increased again, accumulating a growth rate of 3.9% in the first half of 2004, compared to the same period of 2003, which corresponds to the creation of 1 million jobs, the highest job creation in the first half of any year. 
22. In the June minutes, the Copom emphasized some reasons why the current economic recovery lagged its effects on the urban unemployment rate estimated by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). Those reasons include the unemployment rate seasonal behavior, the labor force increase and the higher expansion of employment out of the largest urban areas. However, in May these factors were offset by other factors that caused the reduction in the unemployment rate, to 12.2% from 13.1% in April. 
23. The Brazilian external sector has continued to post sizeable results. The trade balance registered a US$3.8 billion surplus in June, a new historical high, accumulating a US$15.0 billion surplus in the first half of the year. Both marginal exports and imports have grown significantly. The BCB’s trade balance projection remains at a high level (US$ 26 billion in 2004), despite the economic activity rebound. As to the current account, the first half of 2004 surplus reached US$2.5 billion. 
24. The external scenario has improved since the last Copom meeting, although some tension has persisted, mainly due to new hikes in oil prices. The pressures on the exchange rate and the country risk have subdued. As a consequence, the exchange rate has appreciated to R$3.00/US$ from R$3.16/US$, with reduced volatility, and the country risk measured by the JP Morgan Chase’s Embi+ decreased to 587 b.p. from 705 b.p. On the other hand, the Brent oil price, after falling in June, increased 12.8%. Even considering a more favorable outlook in the last few weeks due to a less uncertain monetary policy in the U.S., the scenario is not completely consolidated, indicating that new episodes of volatility might occur in the future. 
25. The deterioration of market inflation expectations, initiated in May, has continued in July, especially for 2004. The median market expectations for IPCA for this year rose to 7.10% from 6.71%, and for 2005, to 5.5% from 5.44%. Inflation expectations for the next twelve months increased to 6.27% from 6.03%. 
26. Despite the recent exchange rate appreciation, the deterioration of inflation expectations, the higher-than-expected June inflation and the increase in the expected annual adjustment of fixed telephone services explain the increase in the Copom's inflation projections for 2004 and 2005. The benchmark scenario projections, based on unchanged Over-Selic and exchange rates throughout the projection horizon, point out to an inflation rate above the 5.5% target for 2004 and slightly above the 4.5% target for 2005. The market scenario, which takes into account the consensus Over-Selic and exchange rates on the eve of the Copom meeting, projects inflation rates above the ones of the benchmark scenario (i.e., above the targets for 2004 and 2005). The Committee also assessed a third hybrid scenario, considering the market exchange rate expectations and an unchanged Over-Selic rate, coming to an inflation projection that stands between the inflation outcomes estimated on the two usual scenarios. 
27. As in previous meetings, the Committee also analyzed the inflation projections for the next 12 months, corresponding to the second half of 2004 and the first half of 2005. This is a period in which inflation will be more sensitive to monetary decisions taken in the next few months, and at the same time, it presents more reliable inflation projections than the ones for the full 2005. The projected inflation for this 12-month period, both on the benchmark and market scenarios, stood slightly above the interval between the central inflation targets for 2004 and 2005. 
28. As highlighted in previous Copom’s minutes, the unstable external scenario has generated a short-term volatility that tends to broaden the uncertainty about the future behavior of inflation. On the one hand, this uncertainty has diminished in the last weeks. On the other hand, several other factors were responsible for the deterioration of the Copom’s inflation projections since the last meeting, despite the exchange rate appreciation in the period. Those factors include the increase of the private-sector inflation expectations, the upward review of fixed telephone tariffs and the acceleration of the economic activity pace. 
29. Regarding economic activity, although fixed capital investment has been recovering, the level of capacity utilization has also increased, reaching historical highs. The fast increase in aggregate demand and in fixed capital investment have generated higher uncertainty about the capacity to expand the supply of goods and services without triggering inflationary pressures. Even considering that monetary policy must be oriented to accommodate the primary effects of supply shocks as those recently observed, it is important to avoid the secondary effects of inflation increases, containing the upward revision of inflation expectations. In addition, it is also essential to carefully evaluate the current and future supply and demand conditions of the economy. 
30. The Committee’s members believe that the maintenance of the current Over-Selic rate for a long period should consolidate a favorable inflation scenario, with the convergence of market inflation expectations and the actual inflation rate to the inflation targets. However, the monetary authority restates that a more active policy stance will be adopted if the projected inflation deviates from the targets, due to an eventual deterioration of the factors that were responsible for the recent increase in inflation projections for 2004 and 2005. 
31. Even with a deteriorated inflationary environment, and the respective change in the required monetary policy stance, there are no reasons to review economic growth expectations. Indeed, by fighting the second-order effects of the shocks recently observed, the monetary policy is aimed at preserving the medium-term sustainable growth, promoting the balance between the aggregate demand expansion and the broadening of the productive capacity of the economy.

06/09/2004;99;Henrique Meirelles;"
1. In July, the Broad National Consumer Price Index (IPCA) rose 0.91%, up from 0.71% in June and 0.51% in May. The IPCA accumulates a 4.42% change in the first seven months of the year, and a 6.81% variation in twelve months. The IPCA rise in July can be ascribed to the increase in specific regulated prices. Some important components of the IPCA in fact decelerated, as in the case of food.
2. The General Price Index (IGP-DI) rose 1.14% in July, compared to 1.29% in June, thus accumulating an 8.11% change in the first seven months of 2004. The deceleration of the IGP-DI in July was due to lower pressures at both the wholesale and the consumer levels. The Wholesale Price Index (IPA-DI), which accounts for 60% of the General Index, rose by 1.35%, down from 1.57% in June. The Consumer Price Index – Brazil (IPC-Br) rose by 0.59%, compared to 0.78% in the previous month. Finally, the National Index of Civil Construction (INCC), with a 10% weight in the IGP-DI, rose by 1.12%, up from 0.70% in June.
3. The main individual contributions to the July IPCA inflation was electricity (0.17 p.p.) and fixed telephone tariffs (0.16 p.p.). Auto-fuel contributed with 0.12 p.p., partially reflecting the 10.8% gasoline price increase to distributors on June 15, as well as the rise in alcohol-based fuel prices. Food prices rose 0.67% (0.72% in June), accounting for 0.15 p.p. of the monthly IPCA change. The inter-harvest period was responsible for specific pressures on the prices of milk and dairy products. Potatoes, sugar, black beans, wheat flour and bread also suffered price increases, while soy oil, vegetables, carioca beans and rice prices fell.
4. In July, market prices increased 0.52% (0.58% in June), accounting for 0.37 p.p. of the monthly IPCA variation, while the increase of 1.89% in regulated prices was responsible for the remaining 0.54 p.p. The deceleration of market prices inflation was disseminated in both food and non-food prices. In fact, 50.3% of the goods and services included in the IPCA basket increased at a lower monthly rate in July, compared with 43.2% in June. Regarding regulated prices, besides gasoline, alcohol-fuel, electricity and fixed telephone prices, road tolls and urban and interstate buses fares also contributed to the rise.
5. The IPA-DI deceleration in July reflected lower rises in both agricultural and industrial prices. The Agriculture-IPA changed 0.26% in July (0.52% in June). This reduction was a consequence of the decrease in prices of cereals and export-oriented crops, as well as lower pressures from the prices of animals and by-products, vegetables, fruit and vegetal oils. In the same period, the industry-IPA decreased to 1.76% from 1.97%, mainly due to the deceleration of chemical prices (to 2.96% from 5.37% in June). Other segments that registered lower changes in July, compared to June, include mechanical, electrical material, leather, personal care, and tobacco.
6. In July, the IPCA core inflation, measured by excluding household food items and regulated prices, registered a 0.47% variation (0.53% in June), accumulating 5.02% in the year and 7.27% in 12 months. The smoothed trimmed-mean core decreased to 0.55% from 0.60% in June, totaling 4.36% in the year and 8.05% in the last 12 months. Without the smoothing procedure for preselected items, the core recorded 0.59% (0.48% in June), 3.56% in the year and 5.76% in twelve months.
7. The IPC-Br core, calculated by the Getúlio Vargas Foundation (FGV) under the symmetric trimmed-mean method, stood at 0.36% in July (0.50% in June), accumulating 6.21% in the last twelve months.
8. In August, consumer-prices inflation should fall, mainly due to lower regulated-prices inflation. Regarding wholesale inflation, a deceleration is also expected as anticipated by the results of the IGP-10 and the first ten-day period of the IGP-M, notwithstanding the continuity of specific adjustments due to increases in international commodity prices.
9. The identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to new available information. The scenario considered in the simulations assumes the following hypotheses:
a. The Copom's projection for the increases of oil and of cooking gas prices in 2004 were maintained at 9.5% and 6.8%, respectively,
b. The projections for the readjustment of household electricity prices and fixed telephone tariffs in 2004 were also unchanged at 11.6% and 12.8%, respectively,
c. Regarding all regulated prices, with a total weight of 28.7% in the July IPCA, the Copom maintained the projection of an 8.3% average rise for 2004,
d. The projection for the readjustment of all regulated prices for 2005, following the model of endogenous determination, which takes into account seasonal components, the exchange rate, market prices inflation and the IGP-DI change, was increased to 6.3% from 6.0%,
e. The projection for the 6-month spread over the Over-Selic rate, following the specification of a Vector Autoregressive model based on the Selic and the swap rates on the eve of the Copom meeting, decreases from 88 basis points in the third quarter of 2004 to 61 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2005.
10. Regarding fiscal policy, it is assumed that the consolidated public sector primary surplus target of 4.25% of the GDP for 2004 and the following two years will be achieved. The related assumptions considered in the previous Copom meeting were maintained.
11. Considering the benchmark scenario hypotheses, including the maintenance of the Over-Selic rate at 16.0% p.a. and of the exchange rate close to the level prevailing on the eve of the Copom meeting (R$3.00), the IPCA inflation was projected above the 5.5% target for 2004 and above the 4.5% target for 2005. According to the market scenario, which takes into consideration the consensus Over-Selic rate and the exchange rate as surveyed by the BCB’s Investor Relations Group – Gerin on the eve of the Copom meeting, inflation is projected above the targets for both 2004 and 2005. 
12. In July, the IPCA inflation acceleration was strongly influenced by the 1.89% increase in regulated prices. Market prices inflation remained high (0.52%), albeit slightly lower than in June (0.58%). Regulated prices have accumulated a 4.69% increase in the first seven months of 2004, compared to 4.42% in the IPCA, thus reverting the trend observed up to June, when market prices changes systemically surpassed regulated prices variations. As to the wholesale inflation, there has been some deceleration since June, both in the agricultural and industrial segments, even though it has remained high. The IPA-DI increased 1.35%, accumulating 9.84% in the year.
13. The smoothed trimmed-mean core IPCA stood at 0.55% in July. Although this has been the lowest rate since February 2004, it is incompatible with the medium-term inflation targets. The nonsmoothed trimmed-mean core posted 0.59%, for the first time since February 2003above the smoothed trimmed-mean core. In the first seven months of the year, the smoothed and nonsmoothed trimmed-mean cores registered 4.36% and 3.56%, respectively, equivalent to annualized figures of 7.59% and 6.19%. Core inflation excluding household food items and regulated prices stood at 0.47% in July, the lowest rate in the year. However, the core by exclusion accumulated in the January-July period (5.01%) is well above the headline inflation.
14. Economic activity has continued to grow vigorously, as proved by different production, sales and employment indicators. According to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics – IBGE, industrial output grew 7.7% in the first half of the year, compared to the same period of 2003. In monthly terms, industrial production grew 0.5% in June (seasonally adjusted), reaching a new historical high, approximately 12% above the recent trough observed in June 2003. Several leading and coincident indicators suggest that the industrial rebound gained momentum in July, as signaled by the shipments of packaging paper (up 3.4% compared to June, s.a.) and by the production of vehicles (up 5.2%, same comparison basis).
15. According to the National Industry Confederation – CNI, industrial sales rose by 16.8% in the first half of the year, compared to the same period of 2003. In June, industrial sales increased 1.2%, s.a., compared to the previous historical high in May. The CNI data have continued to point out a higher growth pace for industrial sales than for industrial production.
16. According to the IBGE, retail sales have also expanded, not only in nominal terms (up 10.92% in the first half of the year, compared to the same period of 2003) but also in volume (up 9.33%). These are the highest growth rates for retail sales since 2001. According to the National Association of Autovehicles Manufacturers – Anfavea, domestic car sales increased 3.2% in July, month-on-month seasonally adjusted, and 21.4% in the January-July period, compared to the same period of 2003.
17. The labor market has benefited from the activity rebound. According to the IBGE, the unemployment rate fell in June for the second consecutive month, to 11.7%. Data from CNI and from the Federation of Industries of São Paulo State – Fiesp confirm a continuous expansion in the level of employment and in the real payroll in the manufacturing industry. According to CNI, real payroll grew 7.8% in the first half of the year. The level of formal employment, according to the Ministry of Labor and Employment, surged 0.5% in June, with more than 1 million jobs created in the first half of the year.
18. As a natural consequence of what has been occurring in the labor market, the recovery process disseminated, reaching not only the credit-sensitive and exports-oriented activities, but also activities dependent on labor market conditions. According to the IBGE, sales in supermarkets, hypermarkets, food, beverages and tobacco rose by 2.8% in the second quarter (seasonally adjusted) and accumulated a 5.4% expansion in the first half of the year, compared to the same period of 2003. In the same comparison basis, sales of fabrics, clothing and shoes increased 3.1% and 7.3%, respectively. Non-durable goods output has also been reacting to the increase in demand and grew 2.1% in the first half of the year, compared to the same period of 2003. In other words, different indicators demonstrate that the activity level is now less supported by the monetary stimulus that triggered the recovery and more dependent on the labor market, as well as on gains in real earnings ensured by the reduction of inflation.
19. Meanwhile, the sectors more sensitive to credit conditions, that have led the economic rebound, have not yet shown any accommodation in the growth pace. According to the IBGE, furniture and appliances sales increased 9.4% in the second quarter (quarter-on-quarter, s.a.), following a 7.2% expansion in the first quarter of the year. Cars and autoparts sales rose by 6.3% against –0.3% in the same periods. The same trend is noticed for durable consumer goods, whose growth rate increased to 7.2% in the second quarter of this year.
20. The quarterly FGV industrial survey reported a capacity utilization of 84.1% in July, s.a., close to the 85.2% historical peak reached in the first quarter of 1995. The level of idle capacity varied heterogeneously among the sectors. From July 2003 to July 2004, capital goods industry increased its capacity utilization to 82.0% from 71.6%, approaching its historical peak of 84.7%. Consumer goods industry performed similarly, raising its capacity utilization to 83.9% from 76.0%, compared to a historical peak of 87.8%. On the other hand, capacity utilization in the intermediate goods industry remained flat in the period, in the range between the average and the historical peak, an interval much narrower than in other sectors. The heterogeneity is even clearer when the data are disaggregated by industrial subsector, with some subsectors close to historical highs and some others that have not yet reached their average levels (the series starts in 1990).
21. Capital goods absorption (domestic production plus net imports) has continued its expansionary trend. Comparing the first half of the year with the same period of 2003, capital goods absorption grew 13.8%. The consolidation of this trend is crucial for the economy to broaden its growth potential. At this stage, however, it is particularly difficult to project the output gap, in an environment of a sharp expansion of demand, as has been observed in the last few quarters.
22. Exports, which are still expanding at a fast pace, accumulated a 34% increase in the first half of the year, compared to the first half of 2003. In the same period, total imports grew 27% and non-oil imports grew 23%, reflecting the strong recovery of domestic demand. The trade balance accumulated a US$18.5 billion surplus in the first seven months of the year, while the current account registered a US$6.2 billion surplus in the same period. Evidence that the U.S. economy may be growing below what was previously expected, with weaker inflationary pressures, lessened the risk of a faster monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve. As a consequence, market volatility has diminished in the last few weeks, what contributed to the maintenance of the Brazilian sovereign risk below 600 basis points. The exchange rate oscillated around the July average (R$3.04/US$), appreciating to around R$3.00/US$ on the eve of the Copom meeting.
23. Oil prices are the main concern in the external front. The recent trend reinforces the fears that oil prices may reach and persist for a longer period of time at higher levels than the ones recently considered as the most likely scenario, even if some reversion in relation to the recent hikes occurs. The Copom's projection for the increase of gasoline prices in 2004 was maintained at 9.5%, which is enough to eliminate the gap between domestic and international prices, considering crude oil at around US$35 per barrel. This benign scenario has been sustained due to the diagnosis that part of the recent volatility in oil prices is due to speculative factors that may dissipate, even in the presence of some geopolitical risks. However, since the last Copom meeting, the balance of risks regarding oil prices increased. These risks may cause a higher-than-expected increase in gasoline prices in 2004, or a greater lag between domestic and international prices to be corrected in 2005. Moreover, regardless of the evolution of domestic gasoline prices, the increase in international oil prices is transmitted to the domestic economy, partly through the intermediate productive chains, such as the petrochemical, and also through the deterioration in inflation expectations of the private sector.
24. The deterioration of market inflation expectations for 2004, initiated in May, has continued since the last Copom meeting. The median IPCA expectation increased to 7.18% from 7.10%. The median expectation for the next twelve months decreased to 6.22% from 6.27%, and the main reason why this happened lies in the fact that the inflation expectation for July 2005 was lower than the one for July 2004. The median of inflation expectations for 2005 remained steady at 5.50%, albeit the mean and the standard deviation of the surveyed sample increased somewhat, a clear evidence of a more pessimistic sentiment of the private sector regarding the 2005 inflation.
25. The Copom’s inflation projections, both in the benchmark and in the market scenarios, have slightly increased compared to last month. The impact caused by the combination of higher market inflation expectations for 2004 and the increase in projected regulated prices in 2005, to 6.3% from 6.0%, more than offset the effect on the inflation projections caused by the increase in the yield curve. The benchmark scenario projections, based on unchanged Over-Selic and exchange rates throughout the projection horizon (at 16% p.a. and R$3.00/US$, respectively), point out to an inflation rate above the 5.5% target for 2004 and above the 4.5% target for 2005. It should be stressed that the projected deviation in relation to the 2005 target is much lower than the one projected for 2004. The market scenario, which takes into account the consensus Over-Selic and exchange rates on the eve of the Copom meeting, projects inflation rates above the ones of the benchmark scenario (i.e., above the targets for 2004 and 2005), since it considers a reduction of the Over-Selic rate and a more depreciated exchange rate. The Copom also assessed a third hybrid scenario, considering an unchanged Over-Selic rate and the exchange rate path expected by the market. Compared to the market scenario, inflation projections were identical for 2004 and slightly below for 2005.
26. As in previous meetings, the Committee also analyzed the inflation projections for the next 12 months, corresponding to the second half of 2004 and the first half of 2005. The projected inflation for this period, both in the benchmark and market scenarios, stood above the interval between the central inflation targets for 2004 and 2005.
27. The strong and continuous economic rebound, which already reaches historical highs, requires extra caution in the conduct of monetary policy, aimed at preserving the balance between aggregate supply and demand. The level of capacity utilization has rapidly increased, approaching historical records in some sectors. Recent data for capital goods domestic absorption and for civil construction activity indicate that fixed capital investment is recovering. However, during periods of reversion in the economic activity cycle, in which fast expansion follow the slow and erratic growth pattern of the last few years, it is natural to have a high degree of uncertainty regarding the speed of growth of the productive capacity in sectors whose current levels of capacity utilization are already high, and also regarding the potential growth trend. In this scenario, with the fast increase in aggregate demand, it is fundamental to carefully assess the risk of an eventual narrowing of the output gap.
28. In the previous Copom´s meetings, the Committee´s members stressed that the maintenance of the current Over-Selic rate for a long period would consolidate a favorable inflation scenario, with the convergence of the actual inflation rate to the inflation targets. However, the monetary authority admitted that a more active policy stance could be adopted if inflation projections deviated from the targets, due to an eventual deterioration of the underlying factors that led to the increase in inflation projections. The Committee´s members understand that since the last meeting two factors enhanced the risks that could jeopardize the accomplishment of the inflation targets. The first one is the increase in oil prices. The possibility of a higher and longer rise in oil prices than previously projected, not accompanied by an adjustment of the monetary policy, could produce second-order effects incompatible with the inflation-targeting regime. The second factor, partially a consequence of the increase in oil prices, is the deterioration of inflation expectations for 2005, which had been steady for some time. As the scenario is not consolidated yet, the Copom will be cautious to the new developments of these factors.
29. Even if the inflationary scenario should require an adjustment of the Over-Selic rate in the future, it is important to reiterate that it should not impact the sustainable growth process of the Brazilian economy. On the contrary, monetary policy contributes to growth by fighting second-order effects of the supply shocks, and by promoting the balance between the expansion of aggregate demand and the broadening of the economy’s productive capacity. Moreover, sustaining inflation in a path consistent with the inflation targets is essential to preserve real earnings, fundamental for the continuous and balanced expansion of the domestic demand, and for the dissemination of the economic growth benefits to the population.

30/09/2004;100;Henrique Meirelles;"1. In August, the Broad National Consumer Price Index (IPCA) rose by 0.69%, down from 0.91% in July. The IPCA fall was mainly due to the lower impact of tariffs that pressured the July IPCA (electricity and fixed telephone). On the other hand, bad weather conditions affected prices of fresh food. The rise in prices of sugar cane by-products also affected inflation, including the indirect impact on gasoline prices (in Brazil, alcohol fuel is added to gasoline). The IPCA accumulates a 5.14% change in the first eight months of the year, and a 7.18% variation in twelve months. 
2. The General Price Index (IGP-DI) rose by 1.31% in August, compared to 1.14% in July, thus accumulating a 9.53% change in the first eight months of the year. The acceleration of the IGP-DI in August was due to higher pressures at both the wholesale and the consumer levels. The Consumer Price Index – Brazil (IPC-Br) rose by 0.79%, while the Wholesale Price Index (IPA-DI) rose by 1.59%, from 0.59% and 1.35%, respectively, in July. The National Index of Civil Construction (INCC), with a 10% weight in the IGP-DI, rose by 0.81%, down from 1.12% in July. Up to August, the IPC-Br, IPA-DI and INCC accumulate changes of 5.11%, 11.58%, and 7.79%, respectively. 
3. Alcohol fuel (0.10 p.p.) and gasoline (0.07 p.p.) were the main individual contributions to the August IPCA inflation. Food prices rose by 0.85% (0.67% in July), accounting for 0.20 p.p. of the monthly IPCA change, mainly due to the 8.1% increase in fresh food prices. The surge in sugar cane prices led to the prices increases of crystal sugar (5.42%) and refined sugar (14.67%). Conversely, important products in the consumer basket registered new price falls in August, including rice, black beans and soy oil. 
4. In August, market prices increased by 0.60% (0.52% in July), accounting for 0.43 p.p. of the monthly IPCA variation, while the 0.92% increase in regulated prices was responsible for the remaining 0.26 p.p. Among market prices, there were pressures coming from non-tradables, which contributed with 0.30 p.p. for the IPCA change, more noticeably from fresh food and maids and housekeeping cleaners. Tradable prices contributed with 0.12 p.p., mainly due to increases in the prices of sugar and new and second-hand cars. Regarding regulated prices, in addition to the price increases of gasoline and alcohol-fuel, there were residual effects of the increases in electricity, fixed telephone prices, and urban buses fares that had already pressured the IPCA in July. 
5. The IPA-DI acceleration in August reflected the rise of both agricultural and industrial prices. The Agriculture-IPA increased by 0.53% (0.26% in July), due to price raises of vegetables, fruit, sugar cane and pork, while cereals and export-oriented crops continued to present price decreases. The industry-IPA increased by 1.98% (from 1.76% in July), mainly due to the acceleration of prices of iron, steel and by-products, plastic materials, paper and cardboard, mechanics and electrical materials, wood and rubber. 
6. Wholesale industrial prices (except fuel) accumulate a 4.97% change in the three-month period ended in August. In the same period, industrial products (except fuel) in the IPCA register a 1.51% average increase. Therefore, there is a significant potential of lagged impacts on consumer prices in the next few months, due to the pass-through of the wholesale industrial inflation. 
7. In August, the IPCA core inflation measured by excluding household food items and regulated prices registered a 0.56% variation (0.46% in July), accumulating a 5.59% change in the year and 7.47% in twelve months. The smoothed trimmed-mean IPCA core stood at 0.55%, the same as in July, totaling 4.93% in the year and 8.01% in the last twelve months. Without the smoothing procedure for pre-selected items, the core recorded 0.53% (0.59% in July), 4.11% in the year and 5.95% in twelve months. 
8. The IPC-Br core inflation, calculated by the Getúlio Vargas Foundation (FGV) under the symmetric trimmed-mean method, stood at 0.42% in August (0.36% in July), accumulating 4.09% in the year and 6.18% in the last twelve months. 
9. In September, consumer-prices inflation should decline, mainly due to lower pressures from regulated prices and from fresh food prices. However, uncertainties stemming from the gap between wholesale and consumer industrial inflation persist. Likewise, the scenario for international oil prices remains uncertain, constituting a potential risk to domestic inflation. 
10. The identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to new available information. The scenario considered in the simulations assumes the following hypotheses: 
a. The Copom's projection for the increase of oil prices in 2004 was maintained at 9.5%, while the projection for the increase of bottled gas prices was reduced to 6.2% from 6.8%, 
b. The projection for the readjustment of household electricity prices in 2004 was revised downwards to 11.5% from 11.6%, while the projection for the readjustment of fixed telephone tariffs was increased to 13.9% from 12.8%, 
c. Regarding all regulated prices, with a total weight of 28.95% in the August IPCA, the Copom projects an average rise of 8.5% in 2004, 0.2 p.p. higher than projected in the August meeting, 
d. The projection for the readjustment of all regulated prices for 2005, following the model of endogenous determination, which takes into account seasonal components, the exchange rate, market prices inflation and the IGP-DI change, was increased to 6.9% from 6.3%, 
e. The projection for the 6-month spread over the Over-Selic rate, following the specification of a Vector Autoregressive model based on the Selic and the swap rates on the eve of the Copom meeting, decreases from 93 basis points in the third quarter of 2004 to 63 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2005. 
11. Regarding fiscal policy, it is assumed that the consolidated public sector primary surplus target of 4.25% of the GDP for 2004 and the following two years will be achieved. The related assumptions considered in the previous Copom meeting were maintained. 
12. Considering the benchmark scenario hypotheses, including the maintenance of the Over-Selic rate at 16.0% p.a. and of the exchange rate close to the level prevailing on the eve of the Copom meeting (R$2.90), the IPCA inflation was projected above the 5.5% target for 2004 and above the 4.5% target for 2005. According to the market scenario, which takes into consideration the consensus Over-Selic rate and the exchange rate as surveyed by the BCB’s Investor Relations Group – Gerin on the eve of the Copom meeting, inflation is projected above the targets for both 2004 and 2005. 
13. The IPCA deceleration to 0.69% in August from 0.91% in July was due to lower pressures on regulated prices, while market prices rose mainly because of increases in fresh food prices. In 2004, market prices inflation averaged 0.60% per month (exactly the same figure registered in August). Only in April did this variation stay below 0.50%. Thus market prices inflation remained systematically above the levels consistent with the inflation targets set for this year and for 2005. Since May, the accumulated change in 12 months of tradable, non-tradable and regulated prices in the IPCA has been showing an upward trend. Regarding wholesale inflation, the IPA-DI increased to 1.59% in August from 1.35% in July. Similarly to what happened in the past, the recent acceleration in industrial wholesale prices shall impact consumer inflation over the next few months. The intensity of this pass-through will depend on final demand conditions. 
14. The IPCA cores remained relatively stable, but in high levels. In the June-August period, the core measured by excluding household food items and regulated prices accumulated an annualized rate of 6.4%, considerably lower than the headline index (9.6%). This difference reflects the substantial contribution of regulated prices and food to inflation in the period. Even excluding the most noticeable sources of pressure on consumer inflation in this period, the 6.4% annual change signals an underlying trend that is not consistent with the inflation target path. In the year up to August, the core by exclusion is still above the headline inflation. The trimmed-mean IPCA cores also remain high, with annualized changes of 6.6% (non-smoothed) and 7.0% (smoothed) in the June-August period, and 6.2% and 7.5%, respectively, in the accumulated of the first eight months of 2004. 
15. Economic activity has continued to gather momentum. According to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), the GDP grew 4.2% in the first half of 2004 compared to the same period of 2003, led by the manufacturing (7.3%) and trade (7.6%) sectors. Seasonally adjusted GDP grew for three quarters in a row at annualized rates above 6%. In July, industrial production continued its upward trend, growing 0.5% over June (seasonally adjusted), and 1.1% in the quarterly moving average. The industrial production seasonally adjusted series has been growing continuously since February. Since May, the series has been above the previous record high, and, even at these high levels, presented vigorous increases in June and July. In the three months ended in July, there was a 3.8% expansion compared to the period ended in April. 
16. The labor market continued to respond to the activity rebound. According to the IBGE, the unemployment rate fell in July for the third consecutive month, standing at 11.2%. Despite the unfavorable seasonality, unemployment rate returned to the levels of December 2003, considerably lower than the 12.8% registered in July 2003. The level of employment has followed an upward trend since January, with a 0.9% growth in July, seasonally adjusted. The level of formal employment, according to the Ministry of Labor and Employment, increased by 0.8% in July, and by 4.1% in the first seven months of the year, with 1,236,689 jobs created in the period, compared to 598,140 and 741,977 in the same periods of 2003 and 2002, respectively. 
17. According to the monthly employment survey of the IBGE, the upward trend in real payroll initiated in January accelerated in June and July. However, average real earnings grew at a slower pace, reflecting the increase of jobs with relatively lower wages. Negotiations for wage readjustments in the first half of the year were very favorable to the recovery of labor income. The Inter-union Department of Statistics and Socioeconomic Studies (Dieese) informed that 47% of the negotiations resulted in readjustments above the INPC inflation, while 32% had readjustments equal to the accumulated INPC. Even with readjustments equal to past inflation, average real earnings tend to increase if future inflation declines, comparatively to past inflation. The current perspective is that negotiations in the second half of this year will be highly favorable to the recovery in labor income. 
18. The recovery in real earnings is an important source of sustainability to the expansion of the aggregate demand, and is paramount for the continuation of the economic rebound in a more balanced and disseminated way. As mentioned in the Minutes of the Copom meeting in July, goods whose sales are less sensitive to credit and more sensitive to income have been showing an accelerating growth trend, mainly as a consequence of the recovery in the labor market. The negative performance of the output of semi and non-durable goods in July, with a seasonally adjusted decline of 1% in relation to June, does not seem to indicate a reversion in this trend. In particular, that latest result reflects a negative performance in the pharmaceutical products sector, which is not attributable to labor income dynamics, as opposed to the positive results of several economic activities strongly dependent on income. 
19. As the industrial production surpasses historical high levels, an important concern to monetary policy is the capacity of the productive sector to accommodate the demand expansion. According to the FGV, the industry presented relatively low levels of idle capacity in July, and in some sectors, the installed capacity utilization was close to historical peaks. This information has been corroborated by the National Industry Confederation (CNI) data, according to which the level of industrial capacity utilization reached 82.8% in July (seasonally adjusted), a historical record. It is important to notice that, as the idle capacity is reduced, there is a gradual effect over the inflation dynamics, because even when production is beyond the existing limits, the marginal cost increases. Emergency measures, such as multiple shifts in production, or imports that would not be competitive in normal market conditions, may be able to avoid shortages, but would not mitigate price pressures inherent to a progressively higher level of capacity utilization. 
20. As the initial monetary impulse loses momentum, and the economic recovery process begins to be sustained on its self-propagation mechanisms, it is natural and sound that, at the margin, production and sales growth rates decelerate. It is even more natural and sound that this deceleration takes place in a situation in which growth rates have been, on average, unusually high, even for initial stages of a cyclical recovery, and the aggregate production level has overcome previous historical highs. Even though the industry growth rates have declined since May, the latest results still show a rather robust growth rate. 
21. A few recent indicators have been interpreted as evidence that a more pronounced deceleration is progressing in a spontaneous fashion, despite the fact that it is difficult to identify turning points in volatile series, such as the ones regarding the level of economic activity. Industrial sales fell 0.4% in July, according to seasonally adjusted data from CNI. The exchange rate appreciation contributed to this result, as nominal exports revenues in Brazilian Reais decreased. Packaging paper shipments fell 4.2% in August, according to data from the Corrugated Paperboard Association (ABPO), seasonally adjusted by the BCB. However, this decrease should be interpreted with caution, as it follows an extraordinary increase of 5.1% in the previous month. Inversely, other important coincident indicators still grew in August, as in the case of vehicles and steel production. In spite of being plausible that some spontaneous accommodation is in fact in course or on the way, there is no data confirming beforehand an accommodation trend intense enough to rule out any concern about a potential gap between supply and demand, as well as about its effects over the inflation dynamics, given the current level of production. 
22. Recent data suggests that fixed capital investment is recovering in an encouraging way. According to the national accounts, measured by the IBGE, the gross fixed capital formation grew 11.8% in the second quarter of 2004, year-on-year, a better performance than the first four quarters of each previous cyclical rebounds in the last 10 years. Domestic absorption of capital goods (capital goods output plus net imports) grew 27.2% from June 2003 to July 2004, again, better than the 13 first months of each of the three previous cyclical rebounds. The historical series of gross fixed capital formation shows, naturally, high degree of correlation with installed capacity utilization and, with some lags, with the sovereign risk. The performance of these leading indicators confirms that there is room for expansion in fixed capital investment in the next months. Although investment has been particularly promising since the beginning of the current growth cycle, the pace of output recovery has also been more intense than usual, which gives room to the uncertainties concerning the speed at which the output gap is closing. 
23. As to the external transactions, exports expanded by 34.8% in the period from January to August, in relation to the same period of the previous year. Imports also increased strongly (29.6%) in the same period. The trade balance and the current account registered surpluses of US$ 22.0 billion and of US$ 8.0 billion, respectively, in the January to August period. From January to June, the manufactured exported volume grew 25.9%. Regarding primary products, the 17.3% increase in the exported volume was accompanied by a 23.1% increase in prices. As far as imports are concerned, durable goods volume rose by 24.8%, while raw materials and intermediate goods increased by 21.5%, in a sharp response to the stronger domestic demand. 
24. Recent data indicate that the growth pace of the U.S. economy has slowed down, while inflation has remained subdued. As a consequence, a more intense hike in U.S. interest rates has become less likely. In contrast to the tension in the second quarter of the year, international financial markets have remained calm. This favorable environment facilitated the financing of the Brazilian external needs and had positive effects over the Brazil risk-premium and the exchange rate, which appreciated to R$/US$2.90 in the first ten days of September, from R$/US$3.00 in August. 
25. International oil prices, on the other hand, continue to be a source of concern. Even though the prices have fallen from the historical records of August, oil prices remain high and very much sensitive to any threat to the larger exporters supply capacity. It is important to emphasize, though, that the existing lag between domestic and international gasoline prices is being temporarily mitigated by a deviation in the international price of gasoline from that of the crude oil. As mentioned in the August Copom’s Minutes, the inflationary risk associated to oil is not only restrained to domestic gasoline prices, but also encompasses other oil intensive products. 
26. Inflation expectations collected by the Gerin have deteriorated again since the last Copom meeting. The median for the 2004 IPCA increased to 7.37%, from 7.18% on the eve of the August meeting. As to the expectations for the 2005 IPCA, the deterioration that had only been affecting the mean and the standard deviation of the distribution, finally affected the median, which increased to 5.70%, from 5.50% in August. For the next 12 months, the median market expectations fell to 6.19% in September, from 6.22% in August, mainly due to the exclusion of the relatively high inflation expectations for August/2004 and the incorporation of a lower expected inflation rate for August/2005. Although the deterioration of expectations has been triggered by the exchange rate depreciation of the second quarter and reinforced by the concerns about oil prices, the reversion of this trend will depend not only on the recent exchange rate appreciation and an eventual more favorable scenario for oil prices but also on other developments, such as the domestic demand conditions and the inflation results along the incoming months. 
27. The Copom projections for the 2004 inflation rate have not changed substantially since the last meeting, in both the benchmark scenario and the market scenario. In both cases the projected inflation is above the 5.5% target. For 2005, the projections made in the benchmark scenario in the previous meeting already pointed out to an inflation rate above the 4.5% target. However, projections were revised upwards due to the incorporation of greater readjustments of regulated prices for the next year, of 6.90%, instead of 6.3%. The market scenario projects inflation rates above the ones of the benchmark scenario – thus, above the inflation target – because it assumes that there will be a slight reduction in the Over-Selic rate in 2005, and some exchange rate depreciation throughout the projection horizon. 
28. The fact that several inflation indices will overcome the 5.5% central target set by the National Monetary Council (CMN) for 2004 will affect, by means of inflationary inertia mechanisms, the inflation rate in 2005. The inertia hits both the regulated prices, due to readjustment clauses based on past inflation, and market prices, whose formation depends partially on future inflation expectations and partially on past inflation. Copom’s estimates indicate that inflationary inertia would have an impact of 0.9 p.p. over the inflation rate for 2005, in the absence of any monetary response. The Copom understands that the flexibility of the inflation-targeting regime allows for the inertia not to be fully fought in a single year, as a way to promote a smoother transition to the inflation targets in the medium run. Similarly to the strategy that was adopted in the past, the Committee understands that it should fight in 2005 a third (1/3) of the referred inertia, temporarily accommodating the remaining two thirds. This decision means that the monetary policy instruments will be calibrated in order to pursue in 2005 an inflation rate of 5.1%, which corresponds to the 4.5% central target set by the CMN, plus 0.6 p.p. related to the partial accommodation of the inflationary inertia inherited from 2004. 
29. Even though the procedure employed by the Copom to estimate the inflationary inertia is very similar to the one used in the past to calculate the inertial component of the adjusted inflation targets, the Committee understands that the current circumstances do not recommend that adjusted target procedures should be entirely reproduced. In particular, the system of adjusted targets allowed for, besides the anticipated decision to partially accommodate the inertia inherited from the previous year, new adjustments throughout the year by the incorporation of the primary effect of certain shocks. The increased stability of Brazil allows for the monetary conduct to be guided in 2005 by a predetermined objective for inflation, restricted to the central target set by the CMN plus the partial accommodation of the inflationary inertia. The establishment of such an objective at this moment is due to the fact that the monetary policy has its effects over economic activity and inflation within some lags, and therefore, requires adjustment with the due anticipation to obtain the desired effects. 
30. It is important to underline that the Copom interprets the 5.1% objective for the inflation rate in 2005 as a judicious exercise of the flexibility represented by the tolerance interval established by the CMN around the central inflation target, which remains unaltered. The fact that the monetary policy will have as an objective an inflation rate that is above the central target even before the beginning of the year suggests that the new shocks that may affect the inflation dynamics should be treated asymmetrically. Therefore, the Copom will have to be even less tolerant in relation to shocks that may increase inflation above the 5.1% objective for 2005, at the same time benefiting from eventual favorable shocks as an opportunity to bring actual inflation close to its target path set by the CMN. 
31. The Copom members agreed that, if the current monetary stance were maintained unchanged, the strong economic expansion would not spontaneously accommodate to a pace consistent with the convergence of inflation to its path. The inflation projections by the Committee confirm the increasing risk that inflation could deviate from its targets. In particular, these projections already point out to an inflation rate above the 5.1% objective for 2005, under the assumption that the Over-Selic rate is maintained at 16% throughout the projection horizon. The underlying inflation trend captured by the several core measures is relatively steady at levels that are inconsistent with the targets. Additional risks to inflation are the deterioration of market inflation expectations, the very indefinite outlook in the global oil market, and the potential pressure of the increase in wholesale industrial inflation, in an environment that favors the re-composition of profit margins, including the ones stemming from wages readjustments that tend to increase average real earnings. 
32. The Copom members consensually concluded that the best stance was to initiate a process of moderate adjustment in the monetary policy instrument. Due to the existing time lags between the implementation of monetary policy and its effects over the economy, central banks have necessarily to act in a preventive way, before contemporary data attests that inflation is out of control or that there are excessive demand pressures. In fact, when considering the prospective scenario for the economy throughout a longer period, the monetary stance aims at avoiding that those risks do materialize. If current data already confirmed an inflation rate out of control or excessive demand pressures, the monetary policy response would have to be different from the one now considered by the Committee. 
33. This moderate adjustment will aim at promoting the convergence of inflation to the targets path, already incorporating the objective of a 5.1% IPCA for 2005. By adjusting the activity recovery in the medium and long runs with the inflation targets, the Copom will avoid more drastic measures in the future in order to disinflate the economy, with eventual significant damages to the economic growth cycle. In this sense, the monetary adjustment main and final objective is to provide conditions for the long run sustainable growth. 
34. Another consensual agreement was the evaluation that the adjustment should come in a gradual way, differently from the shock treatment recommended to crisis episodes faced by Brazil in the past. Five members of the Copom concluded that a 0.25 percentage point increase in the Over-Selic rate would be adequate to initiate the adjustment process, making it as smooth as possible, and minimizing the initial turbulence risks. The other three members voted for an increase of 0.5 p.p., which, according to their evaluation, would better signal the magnitude of the overall adjustment required to bring inflation back to the targets path, and would better correspond to the optimal speed of implementation of this adjustment process.

21/02/2007;124;Henrique Meirelles;"1. IPCA inflation accelerated in the last quarter of 2006, averaging 0.37% up from 0.15% in the third quarter and 0.03% in the second quarter of last year. In December, inflation reached 0.48%, above the 0.31% recorded in November and slightly above expectations registered on the eve of the IPCA release, and also above the expectations that prevailed at the end of December. Twelve-month trailing inflation also accelerated in December, compared to 3.02% in November. Favorable developments in the last months contributed to reach an inflation of 3.14% in 2006, down from 5.69% in 2005, the lowest annual inflation since the adoption of the inflation targeting regime, in 1999. Market prices increased 2.57% in 2006 (tradable prices contributed 1.31%, while non-tradable prices accounted for 3.99%), whilst regulated prices increased 4.27%. Therefore, for the third consecutive year, inflation stood within the tolerance intervals established by the National Monetary Council. Inflation acceleration in December was due to the increase in regulated prices (0.83% up from 0.00% in November), mainly driven by the urban bus fares, and not completely offset by the decrease in market prices inflation (0.32% down from 0.45% in November). Amongst market prices, tradable prices inflation decreased to 0.40% in December down from 0.54% in November, while non-tradable prices decreased to 0.24% down from 0.37%. Services inflation stood at 0.19% in December, unchanged relative to November, and slightly below the 0.22% observed in December 2005. In 2006, services inflation decreased to 5.48%, down from 6.78% in 2005. Partial January data, already captured by the IPCA-15 and underlying inflation measures, suggest that the short-term increasing IPCA trend should intensify. Despite the recent inflation acceleration in the last months, the most likely scenario is that inflation evolves according to the targets path. 
2. Similarly to the headline result, IPCA core inflation measures calculated by the BCB also increased in December, on a month-on-month basis. Core inflation by exclusion of household food items and regulated prices increased to 0.34% in December, up from 0.23% in November and 0.30% in October. Smoothed trimmed means core increased to 0.38%, up from 0.27% in November and 0.32% in October, and continued to record the strongest rigidity among the three core measures. Conversely, after registering reduction in November to 0.12% down from 0.19% in October, the non-smoothed trimmed means core increased to 0.27% in December. Despite the recent increases, the cores continue to present a downward trend on a twelve-month basis, except for the core by exclusion, which slightly increased. According to the same comparison basis, the inflation cores recorded 3.56%, 4.63% and 2.76%, respectively, in December, compared to 3.52%, 4.68% and 2.83% in November. Similarly to the headline result, both the core inflation by exclusion and the non-smoothed trimmed means core stood below the central target in 2006. On the other hand, the smoothed core inflation has converged more slowly to the target, reaching 4.63% in 2006, and therefore, above the central target for the year. 
3. The General Price Index (IGP-DI) inflation decelerated in the last two months of 2006, to 0.26% in December, down from 0.57% in November and 0.81% in October. This deceleration was mainly driven by wholesale price inflation. The Wholesale Price Index (IPA-DI) inflation cooled to 0.11% in December, down from 0.75% in November. On the other hand, both the INCC-DI and the IPC-DI increased in December, month-on-month. The downturn in IPA-DI was due to the deflation in agricultural prices in December (-0.66% down from 2.39% in November), after several consecutive increases, whilst industrial prices accelerated. As a consequence, the IGP-DI increased 3.79% in 2006, up from 1.22% in 2005. This acceleration was driven by wholesale price inflation, and more specifically, by the significant upturn in agricultural prices in the second half of the year. After several months of deflation (reaching -3.14% in the twelve months through April), the IPA-DI reached 4.29% in 2006. After recording –13.19% in the twelve months through March, the Agricultural IPA totaled 6.92% in the year. As highlighted in previous Copom Minutes, the effects of wholesale prices over consumer inflation will depend on prospective demand conditions and price-setters’ expectations for the future inflation path. 
4. Industrial production, according to IBGE month-on-month seasonally adjusted data, expanded by 1.0% in October and 0.8% in November. Compared to the same months last year, the increases totaled 4.9% and 4.2%, respectively. In the year through November, industrial production reached 3.1%, while on a twelve-month trailing basis, industrial output reached 3.0%, the third positive result according to the same comparison basis, and indicating industrial activity acceleration. On a three-month moving average basis, industrial production increased for the eightieth consecutive month in November. The expansion in manufacturing activity in November reached 14 out of the 23 activities with seasonally adjusted data, with highlights to other transportation equipment (10.1%) and beverages (4.8%). For December, leading and coincident indicators suggest accommodation of the trend, which should not surprise in light of the strong increment recorded in the preceding months. However, several incentive factors, including the monetary easing already implemented and the fiscal impulses, suggest that the expanding trend in industry shall accelerate in 2007. 
5. Disaggregated industrial data showed month-on-month seasonally adjusted expansions of 2.2% in capital goods production and 1.6% in intermediate goods production, after two months of contraction, but a 0.1% reduction in durable consumer goods production in November. Compared to the same month last year, all categories increased, with highlights to the expansions of durable consumer goods production (10.4%) and capital goods production (7.9%). In the year through November these use categories increased by 7.3% and 5.7%, respectively. The strong growth of durable consumer goods production reflects, among other factors, the recovery of real earnings and the expansion of credit. The expansion of capital goods production is due to positive prospects for domestic demand growth, and also to the influence of favorable international prices in the purchase of capital goods destined to several industrial sectors. 
6. Labor market performance remains positive, with decreasing unemployment rate, creation of formal jobs and higher purchase power of workers. The unemployment rate in the six main metropolitan areas reached 9.5% in November, compared to 9.8% in October and 9.6% in November 2005. Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte and Porto Alegre metropolitan areas recorded the lowest unemployment rates for November months since the beginning of the IBGE series. The unemployment rate contracted in all the six metropolitan areas surveyed, except for Rio de Janeiro, which recorded stability. As a result, the average unemployment rate in the year through November was 0.2 percentage points higher than that of the same period last year, notwithstanding the 2.4% expansion in labor force. The number of employed people grew 2.2% in the year through November and 3.0% in the month, compared to the same month last year, indicating that the pace of jobs creation remains robust. Still in November, the purchase power of workers increased a month-on-month 0.6% and 5.7% over the same month last year, for a 4.3% expansion in the year through November. In addition, real payrolls increased 6.6% in the same period, an important factor for the growth of aggregate demand. According to the National Industry Confederation (CNI), manufacturing employment increased a month-on-month seasonally adjusted 0.5% both in October and in November, consolidating a five-consecutive-month expansion. Compared to the same months last year, manufacturing employment grew 3.2% and 3.9%, respectively. In the year through November, it reached 2.1%, compared to the same period last year. Regarding formal employment, data from the Ministry of Labor and Employment (MTE) confirm the continuity of the ongoing expansion. In November, the number of jobs increased 0.4%, on a month-on-month seasonally adjusted basis. In the year through November, the number of jobs expanded by 4.9%, the same rate observed in the last twelve months, mainly driven by the expansions of 9.4% in civil construction and 6.0% in the retail sector. With the creation of 32,579 jobs in November, formal job creation reached 1,546,179 in 2006. In the twelve months through November, 1,259,460 jobs were created. 
7. Retail sales continued to expand in November 2006. IBGE data recorded a month-on-month seasonally adjusted 0.6% in retail sales for November and 0.5% for October. Compared to the same months of last year, retail sales grew 7.0% in October and 9.2% in November. In the year through November, retail sales expanded by 6.2%, mainly driven by furniture and domestic appliances sales (10.9%) and hyper- and supermarket sales (7.6%). The positive performance of retail sales is not restricted to income- and labor-sensitive items, but also comprises credit-sensitive items. Expanded retail sales, which include the sales of construction material and vehicles, motorcycles, parts and pieces, increased 10.2%, compared to November 2005 results, reflecting expansions of 10.4% and 12.2%, respectively, in the sales of these segments, fostered by positive credit conditions. In the year through November, expanded retail sales expanded by 6.5%. Retail sales expansion is expected to continue in 2007, boosted by positive labor market and income developments, credit expansion and the effects of the monetary easing cycle, as well as by the recovery in consumer confidence. 
8. Installed capacity utilization in the manufacturing industry reached 82.1% in November up from 82.0% in October, according to CNI data seasonally adjusted by the BCB. Considering non-seasonally adjusted data, the average installed capacity utilization through November stood 0.2 p.p. below that of the same period last year. Since July, utilization rates have been at higher levels than those observed in the same months of 2005. Disaggregated indicators compiled by the FGV show utilization rates at historically high levels for civil construction and capital goods, whose production has vigorously expanded. Despite industrial production growth, average utilization has shown relative stability, which reflects the improvements in the productive capacity. In fact, recent data regarding output and absorption of capital goods suggest a robust ongoing expansion of investments. In the year through November, the absorption of capital goods expanded by 9.2%, mainly driven by the increases in capital goods imports volume (24.0%) and in capital goods production (5.7%). Civil construction inputs expanded by 4.9%, according to the same comparison basis. Therefore, despite the ongoing aggregate demand expansion, relevant aggregate supply imbalances that could jeopardy the inflation targets are not anticipated in the coming quarters. As stressed in previous Copom Minutes, the inflation trajectory is closely linked to current and prospective developments with regard to the expansion of supply to adequately meet demand conditions. 
9. The trade balance continues to present robust results, confirming previous Copom assessments regarding important structural changes in the Brazilian external trade. In 2006, the trade balance reached US$46.1 billion, 3% above the level reached in 2005. This result was driven by the record results of exports (US$137.5 billion) and imports (US$91.4 billion). Despite significant, twelve-month trailing surplus through December was lower than the US$46.3 billion record high observed in October. As a result of domestic demand recovery, imports have outperformed on the margin, gradually compressing trade balance results. As a consequence, external results in 2007 are expected to be lower than those observed in 2005-2006, but still high for the Brazilian historical standards. The current account surplus stood at US$1.5 billion in November, reaching US$13.2 billion in the year, or 1.6% of GDP, for a US$14.0 billion surplus in the twelve months through November, or 1.5% of GDP. 
10. Regarding the international scenario, the uncertainties regarding the monetary policy stance in the US persist. Although additional interest rate increases cannot be discarded, the consensus points to the fact that the tightening cycle may have already ended. On the other hand, even though the recession scenario in the US economy seems to be less plausible, there are uncertainties about the magnitude of the US economy deceleration. The uncertainties regarding monetary policy in Europe and Japan also persist. However, it bears emphasizing, so far, the limited effects of the less clear international outlook observed in the last months, when the concerns stated above were already present, particularly with regard to the increased risk aversion, commodities prices trajectory, and lower international liquidity. In fact, after an up-tick in May, the sovereign risk reached historically low levels in the last months. This fact corroborates recurrent analysis, expressed in previous Press Releases and Inflation Reports, that the Brazilian economy is more resilient to external shocks. In this context, the Copom reaffirms that the continued disinflation, robust and persistent trade surpluses, adequate public sector's primary surpluses, the buildup of international reserves, improved public sector's debt profile and buyback of external debt have strengthened the domestic resilience to external shocks. Therefore, the Copom continues to assign low probability to a significant deterioration in international financial market conditions that could affect Brazilian external financing. 
11. Another concern regarding the international outlook, oil prices, has continued to dampen. Oil prices slightly decreased since the last Copom meeting, contributing to cool down uncertainties associated with its evolution and effects on the world economy. Oil prices are below the lowest prices observed in the last 18 months, due to the exceptionally mild winter in the Northern Hemisphere and apparent difficulties that Opec faced to control supply. In spite of the recent decrease, oil prices still present high volatility, reflecting, among other factors, geopolitical tensions and weather conditions. However, the scenario considered by the Copom, which attributes no change to domestic gasoline prices in 2007, has become more likely to occur, and the risks related to its materialization have decreased significantly. Despite the stability in domestic gasoline prices, changes in international oil prices affect domestic oil prices, for instance, through productive chains, such as the petrochemical, as well as through the deterioration of market inflation expectations. 
12. The identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available information. The scenario considered in the simulations utilized the following assumptions: a) Compared to the values considered in the December Inflation Report, the projection for gasoline and bottled gas prices adjustments in 2007 were both changed to 0%; b) Considering the same comparison basis, the projections for household electricity and fixed telephone prices adjustments in 2007 were changed to 4.6% and 3.9%, respectively; c) The projection for regulated prices inflation in 2007 decreased to 4.5% from 4.8% (December Inflation Report). These items, according to the weights released by the IBGE, represent 31.04% of the total December IPCA; d) The projection for regulated prices inflation in 2008 was maintained at 5.6%, as presented in the December Inflation Report. This projection for regulated prices is based on the endogenous determination model. This model considers the effects of seasonal components, exchange rate change, market prices inflation and the IGP; e) The projection for the spreads over the Selic rate, using a Vector Autoregressive model based on the Selic and 180-day swap rates on the eve of the meeting, stood at 53 b.p. in the fourth quarter of 2007, reaching 70 b.p. in the last quarter of 2008. 
13. Regarding fiscal policy, it is assumed that the consolidated public sector primary surplus target of 4.25% of GDP in 2007 and 2008 will be achieved, adjusted by the possibility of a 0.5 p.p. reduction in this percentage due to the implementation of PPI (Investment Pilot Plan). The related assumptions considered in the previous meeting were maintained. 
14. Since the November Copom meeting, median IPCA inflation expectations for 2007, compiled by the BCB’s Investor Relations Group (Gerin), decreased slightly to 4.07% from 4.10%. This decrease was mainly driven by lower inflation projected for the second and third quarters of the year. The twelve-month ahead inflation expectations decreased to 4.04% from 4.17%. For 2008, inflation expectations decreased to 4.0% from 4.3%. As mentioned in previous Minutes, these developments suggest the consolidation of a more favorable long-term macroeconomic scenario. 
15. The 2007 inflation forecast under the benchmark scenario – which assumes the maintenance of the Selic rate at 13.25% and the exchange rate at R$/US$2.15 during the forecast period – decreased compared to the values considered at the November Copom meeting, remaining below the 4.50% target established by the CMN for the year. The forecast based on the market scenario – which incorporates the consensus exchange and Selic rates trajectories collected by Gerin on the eve of the Copom meeting – also remained below the values considered in the November Copom meeting, and below the central target for the year. The projections for 2008, according to both scenarios, reduced relative to the November projections, remaining below the 4.50% target in the benchmark scenario, and above the 4.50% target in the market scenario. 
16. The Copom reaffirms the view expressed in previous Minutes, that besides containing short-term inflationary pressures, monetary policy has also contributed significantly for the consolidation of a favorable long-term macroeconomic environment. Economic activity data still do not suggest high likelihood of important pressures over short-run inflation. Imports expansion has contributed significantly to this process, complementing domestic production and, therefore, limiting potential inflationary effects of aggregate demand sustained growth. In addition, despite the prospects of lower liquidity in international markets, due to the interest rates increase in industrialized economies, the external outlook, particularly regarding Brazilian external financing, remains favorable even in a context of moderation in international growth. The favorable external outlook strengthened as international oil prices decreased significantly in the last weeks. Therefore, the prospects for the inflation trajectory remain benign. As in the November meeting, the Copom emphasizes that the main challenge of the monetary policy in this context is to guarantee the consolidation of future positive developments. 
17. The Copom evaluates that pressures stemming from food and regulated prices, mainly public transportation fares in some state capitals, have driven the short-term inflation increase. Since these effects have not exhausted yet, upcoming inflation indicators will likely reflect those increases. Due to the nature of such pressures, they are expected to be temporary, with decreasing intensity throughout time, without necessarily affecting longer-time horizons. However, the Copom will continue to manage the monetary policy stance so that the gains obtained in inflation control in recent years become permanent. In this respect, the Copom will carefully monitor the evolution of inflation and the several core inflation measures in the upcoming months, discriminating between one-off and persistent or generalized price increases, and promptly adjusting the monetary policy stance to the circumstances. 
18. The preservation of inflation rates in line with the targets path and the consolidation of a long-lasting stable macroeconomic scenario will contribute to the progressive reduction of macroeconomic risk perception underway. The scope for a reduction in real interest rates in the future will naturally follow as a consequence of this improved perception. The Copom evaluates that its cautious monetary policy stance has been critical to increasing the probability of inflation convergence to the targets path. For this to materialize, however, it is important that forward-looking inflation indicators remain consistent with the recent benign inflation outlook observed in the last quarters. 
19. The Copom emphasizes, once again, that there are important time lags in the transmission of monetary policy stance to economic activity and inflation. Since the beginning of the monetary easing cycle, in September 2005, the Selic rate has already been reduced by 650 b.p., with the greater part of the reduction concentrated in the second half of 2006. Consequently, the activity level has not completely mirrored the effects of the interest rates cuts, as well as the effects of the economic activity resumption on inflation have not completely materialized. Therefore, the evaluation of alternative monetary policy stances should necessarily focus on the prospective inflation scenario and its risks, instead of current inflation indicators. 
20. During the coming months, employment and income expansions and credit growth will continue to bolster economic activity. As mentioned in the November Copom Minutes, activity level should also reflect the effects of governmental transfers and other fiscal impulses occurred in 2006 and expected for this year. Consequently, the lagged effects of interest rates cuts on an increasingly robust aggregate demand will add up to other factors that will continue to contribute to this expansion. 
21. Given the reasons stated above, the Copom considered again, as in its three previous meetings, the convenience of reducing the Selic target by 25 basis points. The Copom members consensually concluded that several factors would justify such decision, and that it would contribute to increase the total adjustment to be implemented. However, there was no consensus that the lower pace of the monetary easing should start at the present meeting. Three members of the Committee voted for a 50-basis-point reduction in the Selic target, considering that the current balance of risks justified such decision. 
22. On the other hand, the majority of the members of the Copom emphasized that the information available at that moment justified a change in the pace of the ongoing monetary easing process. Given the existing incentives for expanding aggregate demand, the uncertainties surrounding the monetary policy transmission mechanisms, the lower distance between the current Selic rate and the medium-term equilibrium interest rates, and the interest rate cuts implemented since September 2005, these Copom members understood that the preservation of important achievements in disinflation and in preserving economic growth, with job creation and rising real income, demanded a more cautious monetary easing stance. This argument is even more relevant considering the signs of heated aggregate demand, the short-term inflation pressures and the fact that the monetary policy decisions should have concentrated effects in the second half of 2007 and 2008, progressively. 
23. Therefore, the Copom decided to reduce in the Selic target by 25 basis points to 13.00% p.a., without bias. Five votes were for the Copom monetary policy action, while three votes were in favor of reducing the Selic target by 50 basis points. 
24. Under an inflation-targeting regime, the monetary authority decides according to inflation prospects, analyzing alternative scenarios for the main variables that determine price dynamics. The international scenario remains favorable, but new elements of uncertainty came up. On the other hand, a set of price pressures, apparently temporary, arises when domestic demand already expands robustly. In such an environment, the monetary authority must remain vigilant, so that short-term uncertainties do not contaminate longer time horizons. Evidently, in case of an exacerbation of the risk factors monitored by the Copom, the monetary policy strategy will be promptly adapted to the circumstances.

It bears noticing that, in contrast to previous quarters, inflation in the last quarter of 2008 totaled 1.09%, quite lower than that registered in the same period of 2007 (1.43%). As a consequence, inflation reached 5.90% in 2008 – the highest change recorded since 2005 – up from 4.46% in 2007 and 6.39% in the last twelve months through November 2008. The acceleration of twelve-month consumer price trailing inflation mirrors the behavior of both regulated prices and market prices. Indeed, market prices and regulated prices increased 7.05% and 3.27%, respectively, up from 5.73% and 1.65% in 2007. Moreover, both prices of tradable goods and non-tradable goods accelerated on a twelve-month trailing basis, reaching 6.99% and 7.09%, respectively (compared to 4.75% and 6.65% in 2007). The price of services, whose dynamics tends to show more persistence than the prices of goods, increased 6.39% in the twelve months through December 2008, compared to 6.48% in November and 5.19% in December 2007. Preliminary data for January point to consumer inflation index above that observed in December. Considering broader intervals, twelve-month IPCA trailing inflation trended upwards since the second quarter of 2007, reached levels close to the upper limit of the tolerance interval after June 2008 and has reduced since October (when it reached 6.41%) – market prices, under this comparison basis, which started to accelerate more intensely from the second quarter of 2007 on, started to cool down in the third quarter of 2008. In the case of regulated prices, whose behavior incorporates more intensely past inflation developments, twelve-month trailing inflation continued to trend upwards. In short, information available suggest that the inflationary cycle observed in the last quarters tends to be gradually overcome by a process that should be led by the behavior of market prices, while regulated price inflation should show more persistence. 
2. The three main underlying inflation measures calculated by the BCB showed divergent behavior in the last months, but converged in December. The core inflation by exclusion of household food items and regulated prices decreased from 0.51% in October to 0.36% in November and 0.33% in December. Smoothed and non-smoothed trimmed means core inflation measures showed relative stability, recording 0.37% and 0.32% in October, 0.35% and 0.28% in November and 0.33% in December, respectively. Similarly to the headline inflation, the three core inflation measures remarkably accelerated in 2008, compared to 2007, with increases from 4.11%, 4.04% and 3.62% to 6.09%, 4.82% and 4.92%, for the core inflation by exclusion, smoothed and non-smoothed trimmed means core inflation, respectively. Also in line with headline inflation, twelve-month trailing core inflation measures seem to have reached record highs in September (smoothed and non-smoothed trimmed means core inflation measures) or in October (core inflation by exclusion of household food items and regulated prices), reducing afterwards, despite to levels above the midpoint of the target. Moreover, it bears emphasizing that the behavior of the IPCA diffusion index, which remarkably increased in November and continued to point to an inflationary process relatively disseminated, reduced in December (from 64.58 to 61.72, compared to 61.98 in December 2007). 
3. The General Price Index (IGP-DI) inflation changed from 0.07% in November to -0.44% in December. On a twelve-month trailing basis, IGP-DI inflation increased 9.10% in December, down from 11.20% in November, compared to 7.89% in December 2007. The acceleration of IGP-DI in 2008 reflected the behavior of its three main components. The Consumer Price Index-Brazil (IPC-Br) increased 6.07% (4.60% in 2007), while the Wholesale Price Index (IPA-DI) totaled 9.80% (9.44% in 2007). According to the same comparison basis, the Civil Construction National Index (INCC) increased 11.87% (6.15% in 2007). Regarding IPA-DI, the inflationary acceleration, under this comparison basis, derives basically from the behavior of industrial prices. The agricultural IPA reached 1.64% (24.82% in 2007), while the elevation of wholesale industrial prices reached 12.96% (4.42% in 2007). It bears noticing that, despite the exchange rate depreciation occurred since August, both wholesale agricultural and industrial prices have showed deflation at the margin. As mentioned in previous Copom Minutes, the Copom evaluates that the effects of wholesale prices over consumer price inflation will depend on current and prospective demand conditions and price-setters’ expectations for the future inflation path. 
4. On a three-month moving average basis, according to data seasonally adjusted by the IBGE, industrial output decreased 2.1% in November, after falling by 0.8% in the previous month. Still considering the seasonally adjusted series, after the 2.8% retreat observed in October, industrial output decreased by 5.2% in November, month-on-month (with less three working days than the previous month). Moreover, it bears emphasizing that the severe climatic conditions observed in the South of the country also influenced the industrial performance in November. As a consequence, industrial output grew 4.7% in the year through November, with respective increases of 4.6% and 6.2% in manufacturing and in mining output. On a year-over-year basis comparison, industrial output retreated by 6.2% in November, with respective falls of 4.6% and 6.3% in mining and manufacturing industries. Data already released for the last months point, in short, to the interruption of the industrial production expansion cycle in the last quarter of 2008. Industrial activity has been influenced by the international crisis, both due to its effects over credit conditions, and over business and households’ expectations. In this context, several industrial segments have been led to adjust inventories and reduce production, with highlights to the sectors of transportation, especially vehicles, mining, ironworks and petrochemical. 
5. Among the use categories, according to data seasonally adjusted by the IBGE, the production of capital goods decreased by 4.0% in November. Regarding the other use categories, intermediate goods production decreased 3.9%, semi-durable consumer goods production retreated by 0.7%, and the production of durable goods production, strongly influenced by the automotive sector, reduced by 20.4%. In the year, capital goods production leads the expansion, with a 16.9% increase, followed by the 7.3% elevation in durable consumer goods production. The recent slowdown in capital goods production reflects the persistence of the international financial turmoil and its consequences over business confidence. On its turn, the cooling in the pace of expansion of durable goods production reflects, predominantly, the tightening of credit conditions, the deterioration of consumer expectations and the process of inventories’ reduction mentioned above. Such developments should continue to be evidenced by the December data. 
6. Labor market started to record ambiguous indicators, combining positive aspects with significant accommodation of formal job creation at the margin. The unemployment rate in the six metropolitan regions covered by the Monthly Labor Survey (PME) increased from 7.5% in October to 7.6% in November, down from 8.3% in November 2007. As a result, the average unemployment rate in the first eleven months of the year was 1.5 p.p. below that observed in the same period of 2007. According to data seasonally adjusted by the BCB, the unemployment rate stood at 7.8% in November, above the 7.6% observed in October, remaining, however, at a historically low level. In November, average earnings increased 11.4% year-over-year (12% in October), totaling increases of 9.9% in the year and 9.6% in the last twelve months. In November, average real earnings increased 0.9% month-on-month and 4.0% year-over-year. In the year through November, average real earnings increased by 3.4%, while employment expanded by 3.8%. As a consequence, real payroll increased 7.4% (6.9% expansion in November, in year-over-year terms), continuing to constitute a key driver for domestic demand growth. According to the National Industry Confederation (CNI) data seasonally adjusted by the BCB, manufacturing employment retreated by 0.6% in November, after increasing by 0.1% in October, resulting in a 0.8% growth in the quarter ended in November, quarter-on-quarter. In year-over-year terms, employment grew 2.9%, totaling 4.2% growth in the last twelve months. According to data seasonally adjusted by the IBGE, manufacturing employment fell 0.6% in November (after falling 0.1% in October and increasing by 0.1% in September), totaling increases of 2.5% in the last twelve months and 0.4% year-over-year. Still regarding employment, data from the Ministry of Labor and Employment (MTE) indicate significant loss of dynamism in the generation of formal employment at the end of 2008. In December, 654,946 jobs were dismissed (compared to the negative result of 40,821 in November), approximately two fold the historical average for the month. On the other hand, employment reached the third best result for the yearly historical series, reaching 1,452 thousand hires for the period, only below the results for 2007 (1,617 thousand jobs) and 2004 (1,523 thousand jobs). Formal employment reduced by 0.2% in December, seasonally adjusted, and observed data point to a 6.4% expansion in the last twelve months. The manufacturing industry recorded the highest dismissal rate, with the reduction of 273,240 jobs (-1.1% seasonally adjusted change), followed by the agricultural and the services sector, which dismissed 134,487 and 117,128 workers, respectively. The civil construction sector dismissed 82,432 workers (-0.7%). The retail sector dismissed 15,092 workers (0.2%). The services sector recorded the highest hiring rate in the year (648,259 jobs, or 6% growth), a historical record high for the sector. The retail sector recorded the second most important growth (382,218 jobs; 6.7%); followed by the civil construction (197,868 jobs; 17.4%) – a record high for the series; and the manufacturing industry (178,675 jobs, or 5.6%). 
7. According to data seasonally adjusted by the IBGE, expanded retail sales decreased by 3.4% in November, after decreasing 8.3% in October. On a year-over-year basis, it reduced by 4.1% and grew 11% in the year through November. The three-month moving average of expanded retail sales decreased 3.7% in the quarter ended in November, compared to the quarter ended in August, according to seasonally adjusted data. On a month-on-month basis, according to seasonally adjusted data, it bears emphasizing the expansion in the sales of “pharmaceutical, medical, orthopedic and perfumery products” (1.6%), “books, newspapers, magazines and stationary” (1.3%) and “hyper- and supermarket and food products” (0.7%). The negative key drivers were “vehicles and motorcycles, part and pieces” (-7.0%) and “office material and equipment” (-9.8%), sectors more sensitive to the credit supply conditions. In the year through November, cumulative growth was more significant in “office material and equipment” (33.2%) and “other personal and domestic articles” (17.8%). Similar to the observed in October and November, expanded retail sales data for December should also evidence the effects of credit supply restrictions and the deterioration of consumer confidence over vehicle sales, already captured by the data from the National Federation of Distribution of Automotive Vehicles (Fenabrave) for this month. However, preliminary evidence for January points to some recovery in the sales of vehicles, partially in response to sectoral incentives granted by the government. The steady growth of retail sales had been reflecting, in short, the performance of both the sectors more sensitive to income and employment expansions and those more sensitive to credit conditions. For the next quarters, the retail sales trajectory will continue to be sustained by fiscal transfers, as well as by real payroll growth, whose evolution may be favored by inflation reduction, but it will also be affected by the changes in the access to credit supply and by the deterioration of consumer confidence. 
8. The installed capacity utilization rate (Nuci) in the manufacturing industry reached 81.3% in November, below the level observed in October, according to CNI data seasonally adjusted by the BCB. According to data seasonally adjusted by CNI, the Nuci in the manufacturing industry also showed reduction, reaching 81.6% in November, down from 82.6% in October. Without the seasonal adjustment, the Nuci stood 2.0 p.p. below the level registered in November 2007. As a consequence, the average rate in the year through November was 0.5 p.p. above the level observed in the same period of 2007. The monthly non-seasonally adjusted Nuci calculated by Fundação Getúlio Vargas (FGV) retreated strongly in December to 80.6%, standing 6.10 p.p. below the level registered in the same month of 2007. The reduction in the Nuci in December 2008, year-over-year, is also observed in the production of consumer goods (-9.5 p.p.), intermediate goods (-6.0 p.p.), capital goods (-2.6 p.p.) and civil construction inputs (- 4.9 p.p.). The reduction on Nuci calculated by CNI and FGV seems to be a result of a combination between the maturity of investment projects and accommodation on economic activity, and points to significant increase of the idle capacity level of the manufacturing industry. On the other hand, recent data about the absorption of capital goods show contraction at the margin, despite continuing to show expansion, compared to the same periods of 2007. The absorption of capital goods decreased 7.7% in November, according to seasonally adjusted data, and expanded by 21.8% in 2008, according to observed data. On its turn, the production of civil construction inputs retreated 4.6% at the margin in November, after showing stability in October, accumulating a 9.7% growth in 2008. In short, evidences so far suggest an ongoing process of reduction in demand pressures on the productive capacity level of the manufacturing industry. As stressed in previous Copom Minutes, the inflation trajectory is closely linked to current and prospective developments related to the expansion of supply of goods and services, to adequately meet demand conditions. 
9. The trade balance continues to register deceleration at the margin, an already anticipated trend, and which is in line with assessments present in previous Inflation Reports and Copom Minutes. In 2008 the trade surplus reached US$24.7 billion (38.2% below 2007). Exports and imports totaled, respectively, US$197.9 billion and US$173.2 billion, equivalent to 23.2% and 43.6% growth, over 2007. The reversal on the appreciation trend of the BRL and the accommodation on the pace of expansion of domestic demand may contribute to the recovery of the trade surplus, while the reduction on price levels of exports acts on the opposite direction. The decrease in the trade surpluses contributed to the US$26.3 billion current account deficit registered in the twelve months through November 2008, equivalent to 1.7% of GDP. On its turn, foreign direct investment reached US$37.8 billion in the twelve months through November, equivalent to 2.4% of GDP. 
10. The period since the last Copom meeting was marked by the continuity of stress on international financial markets, which originated in the US and Europe, but whose impact on emerging economies has continued being significant. The increased risk aversion, observed since mid-September, after the bankruptcy of an important US financial institution, led the authorities in the US, Europe and Oceania to intervene in an unprecedentedly way in their financial systems, using wide range of instruments, in order to ensure minimum conditions of operation and liquidity in money markets. Systemic risk perception, which has shown some moderation, intensified in the last weeks. The international liquidity contraction has been contributing to a deleverage process by asset managers, which, in turn, has been pressuring down the prices of financial assets. In an environment of increased risk aversion and shortage of capital flows, the volatility of emerging economies’ currencies continues present, despite not showing the generalized trend of depreciation against the US dollar observed in the last months of 2008. 
11. Regarding the global macroeconomic scenario, contraction trends prevail over inflationary pressures. The dominant view still points to the expansion, despite at quite modest pace, of global economic activity in 2009, but data released in the last weeks indicate a more intense and generalized cooling of activity in mature economies and also in several emerging economies. There are evidences that the deeper weakening of economic activity in Europe and parts of Asia was in a significant manner due to the negative shock in the terms of trade caused by the elevation of commodities prices, which is being reverted. On the other hand, the problems in the financial system have been aggravated by a cyclical deterioration in the quality of credit, which tends to reinforce the contraction in financial conditions and, as a consequence, the risk of intensification of deceleration. The US economy, in particular, has been in recession since the end of 2007 and still continues to suffer the impacts of the housing sector crisis, with spillover effects on the labor market, whose weakening, together with the negative wealth effect associated to the fall in the prices of financial assets, has affected consumers’ confidence, significantly contributing for depressing expenditure. Moreover, the prevailing interpretation is that the activity in Europe and Japan should continue to lose dynamism in the next months. In mature economies, where inflation expectations are better anchored and economic activity is decelerating considerably, inflationary pressures have reduced fast. In emerging economies, where the secondary effects of raw materials price increases over consumer prices and the heated demand pressures over the supply expansion capacity had been more intense, inflationary pressures have also been declining, although they show, in many cases, more persistence. In this context, the monetary policy stance is mainly expansionist in mature economies, whereas in emerging economies, which have been affected by the exchange rate depreciation trend, in addition to the facts already mentioned, the reaction seems to be more heterogeneous, but expansionist bias also prevails. In mature economies, the authorities have been announcing a series of initiatives aimed at sustaining economic activity, particularly through fiscal incentives, which could contribute to a gradual economic recovery. On the other hand, estimates on the fiscal costs for packages of macroeconomic stimulus and support to the financial sector have been increasing, which has caused pressures on the assessment of risk on many sovereign credits, even in advanced economies. 
12. Oil prices remain highly volatile, despite currently being close to the levels observed at the last Copom meeting. Future markets quotations have also shown high volatility, without a defined trend. Uncertainty concerning these quotations remains high, as the prospective scenario depends on the evolution of demand, especially in emerging countries, on the supply’s reaction to stimuli stemming from previous changes on relative prices and on the geopolitical issues that affect the price of this commodity. Nonetheless, despite the great uncertainty inherent to the projections of oil prices’ trajectory, the main scenario adopted by the Copom, which assumes unchanged gasoline prices in 2009, remains plausible, but with the persistence of the current scenario in the oil market, it does not seem prudent to completely disregard the hypothesis of oil price reductions in 2009. However, it bears highlighting that, regardless of the behavior of domestic gasoline prices, the reduction in international oil prices observed in the second half of 2008 can eventually affect domestic prices both through productive chains, such as the petrochemical, as well as through the potential effect over inflation expectations. Conversely, prices of agricultural commodities such as wheat, soybeans and corn, which impact particularly the evolution of food costs, have remarkably increased since the last Copom meeting, reacting both to weather problems in important production regions, as well as to the apparent exhaustion of investment repositioning by non-traditional investors that had been allocating resources to these markets. 
13. The identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available information. The scenario considered in the simulations was based in the following assumptions: a) the projected adjustment for 2009 for both gasoline and bottled gas prices were maintained at 0%; b) the projected adjustment for 2009 for fixed telephone and electricity prices were kept at 5.0% and 8.1%, respectively, unchanged relative to the values considered in the December Copom meeting; c) the projection for regulated prices inflation in 2009, based on individual items, was maintained unchanged at 5.5%, relative to the December Copom meeting. This set of prices, according to data released by the IGBE, corresponded to 29.56% of the total December IPCA;  d) the projection of regulated prices inflation for 2010 stood at 4.8%. This projection is based on the endogenous determination model for regulated prices, which computes, among other factors, seasonal components, foreign exchange rate changes, market prices inflation and the IGP (General Price Index) variation; and; e) the projection for the spreads over the Selic rate, on the benchmark scenario, based on the 360- day swap rates, estimates a 5 bps spread in the fourth quarter of 2009 and 22 bps in the last quarter of 2010. The identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available information. 
14. Regarding fiscal policy, the projections assume the achievement of the public sector primary surplus target of 3.8% of GDP in 2008 and 2009. The related assumptions considered in the previous meeting were maintained. 
15. Since the last Copom meeting, according to the median IPCA inflation expectations compiled by the BCB’s Investor Relations Group (Gerin), the 2009 IPCA variation noticeably reduced to 4.80% from 5.20%. For 2010, inflation expectations stand at 4.50%. 
16. Considering the hypotheses under the benchmark scenario – which assumes the maintenance of the exchange rate at R$2,35/US$1.00 and the Selic rate at 13.75% during the forecast period – the projection for the 2009 IPCA inflation decreased relative to the figure considered in the December Copom meeting, and remains below the 4.5% target established by the National Monetary Council (CMN). According to the forecast based on the market scenario – which incorporates the consensus exchange and Selic rates trajectories collected by Gerin on the eve of the Copom meeting – IPCA inflation forecast for 2009 slightly decreased compared to the figure considered in the previous Copom meeting, but remained around the central target for the year. Inflation projection for 2010, based on the benchmark scenario, reduced compared to the figure considered in the December “Inflation Report” and is considerably below the 4.5% central target for that year. On the other hand, considering the market scenario, the inflation projection slightly increased, staying around the 4.50% central target. 
17. The Copom evaluates that the monetary policy should contribute for the consolidation of a favorable long-term macroeconomic environment. Economic activity data indicate that the pace of domestic demand expansion, which continued quite robust until the third quarter of 2008, and was at least partially responsible for the inflationary pressures, has considerably lost momentum since then. This deceleration is partly a result of a substantial and generalized cooling of economy activity on both emerging and G-8 economies. On its turn, the increase in risk aversion and the unprecedentedly constraints observed in liquidity conditions in the international markets continue to impose adjustments in the balance of payments. In general terms, the influence of the external scenario on the future trajectory of Brazilian inflation continues to be subject to contradictory effects, which can act with distinct intensity throughout time and surrounded by significant uncertainty. On the one hand, the economic cooling has caused an increase in risk aversion, impacting the demand for Brazilian assets, and consequently, depreciating their prices. On the other hand, the more generalized economic deceleration in the last months, which may persist in the upcoming quarters, has caused the cooling of both commodities prices and external demand, and has also negatively impacted local financial conditions. Moreover, the trajectory of price indices evidences the reduction of inflationary external pressures, especially in mature economies, but also in some emerging economies. As a consequence, the net effect of the global deceleration over the inflation trajectory seems to be, so far, predominantly benign. The Copom emphasizes that the main challenge of monetary policy in this context is to guarantee the maintenance of favorable results achieved in the last years. 
18. The Copom evaluates that the probability that initially localized inflationary pressures may cause risks to domestic inflation trajectory diminished. The evidences of accommodation of domestic demand, and reduction of inflationary pressures over the market of factors, despite remaining surrounded by uncertainty, may mitigate the risk of pass-through of wholesale prices (which have been showing deflation in the last months) upward pressures to consumer price inflation. The Committee evaluates that the materialization of this pass-through, as well as the generalization of pressures initially localized on consumer prices, depend critically on economic agents’ inflation expectations for 2009. The 2009 inflation expectations remain in levels above the inflation target, despite having remarkably decreased since the last Copom meeting and continue to be carefully monitored. Additionally, it is worth noticing that, according to data available, domestic demand should exert lesser pressures over the prices of non-tradable items, such as services, in the upcoming quarters. In this context, the Copom reaffirms that it will continue to conduct its actions in order to ensure that the gains obtained in inflation control in recent years become permanent. 
19. Copom emphasizes, once again, that there are important time lags between the implementation of monetary policy and its effects on economic activity and inflation. Therefore, the evaluation of alternative options for monetary policy should necessarily focus on the forward-looking inflation scenario and its risks, instead of current inflation indices. This point of view is even more important in periods of higher uncertainty. 
20. Prospects for the evolution of economic activity have continued to deteriorate since the last Copom meeting, despite the fact that industrial activity data have been partially reflecting a process of inventory retreat, which tends to exhaust. It is particularly important to notice, the effects of the international crisis over domestic financial conditions have resulted in severe decline of the credit contribution to support domestic demand. Additionally, the intensification of the international crisis has caused a negative effect on consumers and businessmen confidence. If this situation persists, the strength of economic activity will increasingly depend on payroll expansion and on the effects of governmental transfers expected for 2009. These considerations become even more relevant considering the fact that the monetary policy decisions will have concentrated impacts in the upcoming quarters. 
21. The Copom evaluates that the loss of strength on domestic demand should result in reduction of inflationary pressures. On the other hand, the remaining risks for the inflationary dynamics derive from the trajectory of Brazilian assets prices, amidst a process of decreasing external sources of funding and mechanisms of price adjustments that contribute to prolong inflationary pressures observed last year. The balance of those influences over the prospective trajectory of inflation will be crucial to the assessment of the various alternatives available for the monetary policy stance. 
22. International evidence, as well as the Brazilian experience, indicates that high inflation rates leads to increase in risk premiums, shortening of planning horizons and, consequently, to lower potential economic growth, besides having regressive effects over income distribution. Therefore, the Copom’s strategy aims to bring inflation back to the midpoint target of 4.5% during 2009, as already established by the CMN, and keep it in a consistent level relative to the target path during 2010. Such strategy, which should have its results evidenced throughout time, takes into account the time lags in the transmission mechanisms and is the most adequate to deal with uncertainties inherent to the process of monetary policy formulation and implementation. 
23. The Copom evaluates that, in light of signs of economic activity slowdown, evidenced since the last meeting regarding, for instance, the industrial production indicators – exacerbated by an inventory cycle –, some available data on labor market and industrial capacity utilization rates, as well as on consumers and businessmen confidence, together with lower inflation expectations for relevant horizons, the risks of non-materialization of a benign inflation scenario, in which IPCA would resume evolution in line with the targets path, have been markedly reduced. Indeed, the evolution of the prospective scenario is reflected on inflation projections considered by the Committee. The Copom also understands that demand deceleration has reduced the pressure over supply conditions observed in most of 2008, which should significantly contribute to deflate the economy. Still, monetary policy should be cautiously conducted, aiming to assure the convergence of inflation to the targets path, despite some scope for an easing process. 
24. The Committee believes that the consolidation of restrictive financial conditions for a longer period should exert in significant contraction effect over demand and, throughout time, a relevant deflation pressure. Under such circumstances, the majority of the Copom members, taking into account the balance of risks for economic activity and, consequently, for the prospective inflation scenario, as well as the absence of clear evidence of effects over.inflation stemming from the depreciation of the exchange rate, in an environment of global reduction of inflationary pressures, has decided, at this moment, to reduce the Selic rate by 100 bps. 
25. Other Copom members evaluate that, in light of the presence of inflationary feedback mechanisms in the economy, as well as the consequences of the balance of payments adjusting process, a more moderate reduction of the Selic rate would represent a more consistent signal of the prospective trend of inflation convergence to the targets path and would be more adequate to an optimal pace of the easing process. 
26. In such context, taking into account inflation prospects, the Copom has decided, at this moment, to reduce the Selic rate to 12.75% p.a., without bias. Five votes were in favor of this monetary policy action while three were in favor of reducing the Selic rate by 75bps. With such action, the Committee has initiates a process of monetary policy easing, immediately accomplishing significant part of the Selic rate movement, without harming the commitment to the inflation target. 
27. Under the inflation targeting regime, the Committee guides its decisions according to projected inflation, analysis of several alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine the forward-looking prices dynamics, and the balance of risks associated to their projections. There are signs that, after a long expansion period, domestic demand has started to have a contraction influence over economic activity, despite persistence of incentive factors, such as income growth. Additionally, it is worth noticing that inflation expectations for 2009 have substantially decreased since the last Committee meeting. On the other hand, the strong global economy deceleration has resulted in downward pressures over wholesale prices, despite the exchange rate adjustment. In such environment, monetary policy can be more flexible without putting at risk inflation convergence to the targets path. Evidently, if deterioration on the risk profile implies shifts to the inflation prospective basic scenario, considered by the Committee at this moment, the monetary policy stance will be promptly adjusted to the circumstances.

25/09/2018;217;Ilan Goldfajn;"1. Recent indicators of economic activity point to the recovery of the Brazilian economy, at a more gradual pace than envisaged early this year.
2. The economy continues to operate with a high level of economic slack, as reflected in the low industrial capacity utilization indexes and, mainly, in the unemployment rate.
3. The global outlook remains challenging, with reduction of risk appetite towards emerging economies. The main risks continue to be associated with normalization of interest rates in some advanced economies and with uncertainty regarding global trade.
4. Various measures of underlying inflation are running at appropriate levels. This includes the components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary policy. 
5. Inflation expectations for 2018 and 2019 collected by the Focus survey are around 4.1%. Expectations for 2020 around 4.0% and those regarding 2021 retreated to around 3.9%.
6. The Copom's inflation projections in the scenario with interest rate and exchange rate paths extracted from the Focus survey stand around 4.1% for 2018, and 4.0% for 2019. This scenario assumes, among other hypotheses, a path for the policy interest rate that ends 2018 at 6.5% p.a., and 2019 at 8.0% p.a., and a path for the exchange rate that ends 2018 at R$/US$ 3.83, and 2019 at R$/US$ 3.75. In this scenario, projections for administered price inflation are 7.7% in 2018, and 5.4% in 2019.
7. In the scenario with a constant interest rate at 6.50% p.a., and a constant exchange rate at R$4.15/US$2, Copom?s inflation projections stand around 4.4% for 2018, and 4.5% for 2019. In this scenario, the inflation projections for administered prices are 8.3% for 2018 and 5.7% for 2019.
8. The Copom?s baseline scenario for inflation encompasses risk factors in both directions.
9. On the one hand, (i) the high level of economic slack may lead to a lower-than-expected prospective inflation trajectory.
10. On the other hand, (ii) frustration of expectations regarding the continuation of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy may affect risk premia and increase the path for inflation over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy.  This risk intensifies in case (iii) the global outlook for emerging economies deteriorates. The Committee judges that the latter risks have increased.
11. The Committee members discussed the evolution of economic activity in light of available data. Indicators and information available after the temporary halt in the transportation sector that occurred at the end of May 2018 point to the continuation of economy recovery of the Brazilian economy. The baseline scenario entertains the continuation of recovery of economic activity, at a more gradual pace than envisaged early this year.
12. Regarding the global outlook, the Committee judges that the scenario remains challenging for emerging economies. The baseline scenario assumes gradual normalization of monetary policy in central economies. The Committee members also mentioned the risks to the continued expansion of international trade, with possible impacts on global growth. In this context, the Copom members once again highlighted the capacity of the Brazilian economy to withstand a setback in the international scenario, given its robust balance of payments and the environment of anchored inflation expectations and prospects of economic recovery. Nevertheless, the Copom pondered the risks stemming from a possible additional deterioration in the outlook for emerging economies, in a context of frustration of expectations regarding the necessary reforms and adjustments in the Brazilian economy.
13. The Copom analyzed the inflation trajectory in the short-term. All members agreed that July and August inflation along with projections for subsequent months corroborated the understanding that the effects of the halt in the transportation sector that occurred in the end of May 2018 were temporary.
14. The Committee members pointed out that several measures of underlying inflation have increased from levels considered low, reaching appropriate levels ? i.e., generally consistent with the inflation target. It is possible that recent relative price changes in a context of anchored inflation expectations have contributed to raise inflation to levels compatible with the inflation targets, without posing risks to the maintenance of these levels once such relative price adjustments have taken place. However, the Committee members considered that the evolution of the prospective inflation path in the medium and long terms ? along with the anchoring of inflation expectations ? should be monitored in order to evaluate possible more enduring effects from shocks on inflation (i.e., their second-round effects).
15. The Committee reaffirmed the understanding that, with anchored inflation expectations, in face of occasional shocks that lead to changes in relative prices, monetary policy should only focus on their second-round effects. The Copom also highlighted that its reaction to possible changes in relative prices will be symmetric, i.e., monetary policy will follow the same principles, whether in face of inflationary shocks (as in the case of a shock leading to a depreciation of the exchange rate) or in face of disinflationary shocks (as in the case of a favorable food price shock). The Committee emphasizes that this prescription requires an environment with anchored expectations.
16. Having established how monetary policy should react to shocks that induce changes in relative prices, the Copom members discussed the extent of the exchange rate pass-through in the Brazilian economy. They assessed that, with the exception of some administered prices, the level of pass-through has been contained. The members pondered, however, that the intensity of pass-through depends on several factors, such as the level of slack in the economy and the degree of anchoring of inflation expectations. The Committee will monitor the different measures of exchange-rate pass-through to both inflation and underlying inflation.
17. The Copom members assessed that economic conditions with anchored inflation expectations, underlying inflation measures at adequate levels, inflation projections close to the target for 2019, and high level of slack in the economy still prescribe accommodative monetary policy, i.e., interest rates below the structural interest level. Although estimates of this rate involve a high degree of uncertainty, the Committee members expressed the view that the current ex-ante real interest rates provide stimulus to the economy.
18. The Committee also debated the conditionalities that would prescribe accommodative monetary policy. All members agreed that the appropriate level of stimulus depends on economic conditions ? in particular, on inflation expectations, the level of economic slack, the balance of risks, and inflation projections. Importantly, the provision of monetary stimulus requires an environment with anchored inflation expectations. The Committee assessed that this stimulus should be removed gradually if the prospective scenario for inflation at the relevant horizon and/or its balance of risks worsen.
19. The Copom stresses that the continuation of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy is essential to the reduction of its structural interest rate. The Committee will continue to reassess the estimates of this rate over time.
20. The Committee members then discussed the evolution of the baseline scenario and the balance of risks since its August meeting (216th meeting) and the appropriate monetary policy decision in light of such evolution.
21. The Committee judged that the outlook evolved in line with the baseline scenario. Regarding the balance of risks, on the one hand, the Committee judged that downward risks for the prospective inflation path due to propagation of low levels of inflation in the recent past have faded. However, the persistence of a high level of economic slack poses downward risks to inflation. On the other hand, it discussed the importance of the continuation of the process of adjustments and reforms in the Brazilian economy and the risks associated with the deterioration of the scenario for emerging economies. Based on both sides of the balance of risks, the Copom members concluded that this balance is asymmetric, as the latter risks have increased.
22. Based on all assessments, the Copom members agreed to maintain the Selic rate at 6.50% p.a.
23. The Copom then discussed the advisability of signaling the future evolution of monetary policy. All members considered that the level of uncertainty of the current environment generates a need for greater flexibility in the conduct of monetary policy, which recommends refraining from providing indications on the next steps of monetary policy. The members of the Copom have, however, considered that it is important to reinforce their commitment to conducting monetary policy in order to maintain the path for prospective inflation in line with the target. This requires flexibility to gradually adjust the conduct of monetary policy when and if needed. This ability to respond to different circumstances contributes to the maintenance of the environment with anchored expectations, which is fundamental to ensure that the achievement of low inflation persists, even in face of adverse shocks.
24. The Copom members reiterated the importance of reaffirming the conduct of monetary policy with an exclusive focus on the evolution of inflation projections and expectations, the balance of risks, and economic activity. Relative price shocks should be tackled only in the secondary impact they may have on prospective inflation. In particular, they reiterated the importance of insisting on communicating that there is no mechanical relationship between recent shocks and the conduct of monetary policy.
25. The Committee members reiterated once again their preference for communicating the conditionalities on the evolution of monetary policy, which better transmits the economic rationality guiding their decisions. This contributes to increase transparency and enhance Copom?s communications. In this context, they reasserted that the next steps in the conduct of monetary policy will continue to depend on the evolution of economic activity, the balance of risks, and on inflation projections and expectations.
26. All Committee members once again emphasized that the approval and implementation of reforms ?notably those of fiscal nature? and adjustments in the Brazilian economy are crucial for the sustainability of the environment of low and stable inflation, for the full operation of monetary policy, and for the reduction of the structural interest rate of the economy, with widespread benefits for society. The Committee also notes that the perception of continuity in the reform agenda affects expectations and current macroeconomic projections.
27. Finally, the Copom stressed the importance of other initiatives aimed at productivity increases, efficiency gains, greater flexibility of the economy, and improvements in the business environment. These efforts are fundamental for the resumption of economic activity and for the development of the Brazilian economy, balance of risks, and the wide array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to maintain the Selic rate at 6.50% p.a. The Committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective inflation and the associated balance of risks and is consistent with the convergence of inflation to the targets over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy, which includes 2019.
29. The Copom emphasizes that the evolution of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy is essential to maintain low inflation in the medium and long run, for the reduction of its structural interest rate, and for sustainable economic recovery. The Committee stresses that the perception of continuation of the reform agenda affects current expectations and macroeconomic projections.
30. The Copom judges that it should base its decisions on the evolution of inflation projections and expectations, of the balance of risks, and of economic activity. Shocks that produce relative price changes should only lead to a monetary policy response to their possible second-round effects (i.e., to the propagation to prices in the economy that are not directly affected by the shock). It is through such second-round effects that these shocks may affect inflation projections and expectations, and change the balance of risks. These effects may be mitigated by the level of economic slack and by inflation expectations anchored around the targets. Therefore, there is no mechanical relationship between recent shocks and the conduct of monetary policy.
31. The Copom reiterates that economic conditions still prescribe stimulative monetary policy, i.e., interest rates below the structural level. This stimulus will begin to be removed gradually if the outlook for inflation at the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy and/or its balance of risks worsen.
32. In the Copom's assessment, the evolution of the baseline scenario and of the balance of risks prescribes keeping the Selic rate at its current level. The Copom emphasizes that the next steps in the conduct of monetary policy will continue to depend on the evolution of economic activity, the balance of risks, and on inflation projections and expectations.

06/11/2018;218;Ilan Goldfajn;"1. Recent indicators of economic activity point to the recovery of the Brazilian economy, at a more gradual pace than envisaged early this year.
2. The economy continues to operate with a high level of economic slack, as reflected in the low industrial capacity utilization indexes and, mainly, in the unemployment rate.
3. The global outlook remains challenging, with risk appetite towards emerging economies at levels below those seen early this year. The main risks continue to be associated with normalization of interest rates in some advanced economies and with uncertainty regarding global trade.
4. Various measures of underlying inflation are running at appropriate levels. This includes the components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary policy.
5. Inflation expectations for 2018, 2019 and 2020 collected by the Focus survey are around 4.4%, 4.2%, and 4.0%, respectively. Expectations for 2021 remain around 3.9%.
6. The Copom's inflation projections in the scenario with Selic and exchange rate paths extracted from the Focus survey stand around 4.4% for 2018, 4.2% for 2019, and 3.7% for 2020. This scenario assumes a path for the Selic rate that ends 2018 at 6.5% p.a., increases to 8% p.a. over the course of 2019, and remains at that level until the end of 2020. It also assumes a path for the exchange rate that ends 2018 at R$/US$ 3.71, 2019 at R$/US$ 3.80, and 2020 at R$/US$ 3.75. In this scenario, the inflation projections for administered prices are 7.4% for 2018, 5.6% for 2019, and 3.9% for 2020.
7. In the scenario with a constant Selic rate at 6.50% p.a., and a constant exchange rate at R$3.70/US$2, Copom?s inflation projections stand around 4.4% for 2018, 4.2% for 2019, and 4.1% for 2020. In this scenario, the inflation projections for administered prices are 7.3% for 2018, 5.4% for 2019, and 4.1% for 2020.
8. The Copom?s baseline scenario for inflation encompasses risk factors in both directions, but with greater weight on the last two risks, listed below.
9. On the one hand, (i) the high level of economic slack may lead to a lower-than-expected prospective inflation trajectory.
10. On the other hand, (ii) frustration of expectations regarding the continuation of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy may affect risk premia and increase the path for inflation over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy. This risk intensifies in case (iii) the global outlook for emerging economies deteriorates. The Committee judges that the degree of asymmetry in the balance of risks has diminished since its previous meeting.
11. The Committee members discussed the evolution of economic activity in light of available data. They concluded that the data indicate continuation of the recovery of economic activity, at a more gradual pace than envisaged early this year. 
12. Regarding the global outlook, the Committee members considered that it remains challenging for emerging economies. They evaluated that, since their previous meeting, risk appetite for assets of these economies stabilized ? in contrast with the worsening trend observed in the previous months. However, the assessment was that this stabilization occurred at levels lower that those observed at the beginning of the year, which implies higher risk premia. In addition, since the previous Copom meeting, prices of risky assets in some advanced economies have shown greater volatility, which contrasts with the favorable evolution observed previously. The Copom?s baseline scenario assumes gradual normalization of monetary policy in central economies. The Committee members also mentioned the risks to the continued expansion of international trade, with possible impacts on global growth, and on the Chinese economy, in particular. In this context, the Copom members once again highlighted the capacity of the Brazilian economy to withstand a setback in the international scenario, given its robust balance of payments and the environment of anchored inflation expectations and prospects of economic recovery. 
13. The members of the Committee also highlighted the reduction of uncertainties in the domestic front, which led to a decline in risk premia embedded in Brazilian asset prices. This decline of uncertainties contributed to reduce the degree of asymmetry in the balance of risks for inflation. Despite this improvement, the Copom members concluded that upward risks to inflation continue to have a greater weight in the balance of risks. 
14. The Copom analyzed the inflation trajectory for the next months. This trajectory should lead to a rise of 12- month inflation, reaching a peak around the second quarter of 2019. Thereafter, 12-month inflation is expected to decline over the remainder of 2019, towards the target. 
15. With regard to underlying inflation, in recent months its various measures have risen from levels considered to be low, reaching levels that the Committee deems appropriate ?i.e., generally consistent with the inflation targets. Recent changes in relative prices, in a context of anchored inflation expectations, seem to have contributed to raise inflation to levels compatible with the inflation targets, without posing risks to the maintenance of inflation at these levels once such relative price adjustments have taken place. However, the Committee members considered that the evolution of the prospective inflation path in the medium and long terms ? along with the anchoring of inflation expectations ? should be monitored in order to evaluate possible more enduring effects from recent shocks to inflation (i.e., their second-round effects).
16. Copom members then discussed the convenience of maintaining in their official documents the message on principles for conducting monetary policy in face of relative price shocks in an inflation targeting regime with anchored expectations. The Copom has communicated that, in this context, monetary policy should focus only on possible second-round effects of relative price changes induced by occasional shocks. It has also stressed that its reaction to possible changes in relative prices will be symmetric, i.e., monetary policy will follow the same principles, whether in face of inflationary shocks (as in the case of a shock leading to a depreciation of the exchange rate) or in face of disinflationary shocks (as in the case of a favorable food price shock). Committee members pondered that it should already be clear that there is no mechanical relationship between shocks that produce relative price adjustments and monetary policy. Hence, they agreed to exclude this message as of their next meeting, with the understanding that this should not be interpreted as a change in the conduct of monetary policy. 
17. The members of the Committee also discussed the extent of the exchange rate pass-through in the Brazilian economy. They assessed that, with the exception of some administered prices, the level of pass-through has been contained. The members pondered, however, that the intensity of pass-through depends on several factors, such as the level of economic slack, and the degree of anchoring of inflation expectations. The Committee will continue to monitor different measures of exchange rate passthrough to both inflation and underlying inflation. 
18. The Copom members assessed that economic conditions with anchored inflation expectations, underlying inflation measures at adequate levels, inflation projections close to the target for 2019 and 2020, and high level of slack in the economy still prescribe accommodative monetary policy, i.e., interest rates below the structural interest rate level. Although estimates of this rate involve a high degree of uncertainty, the Committee members expressed the view that the current ex-ante real interest rates provide stimulus to the economy. 
19. The Committee also discussed the conditionalities that would prescribe accommodative monetary policy. All members agreed that the appropriate level of stimulus depends on economic conditions ? in particular, on inflation expectations, the level of economic slack, the balance of risks, and inflation projections. Importantly, the provision of monetary stimulus requires an environment with anchored inflation expectations. The Committee assessed that this stimulus should be removed gradually if the prospective scenario for inflation at the relevant horizon and/or its balance of risks worsen. 
20. The Copom stresses that the continuation of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy is essential to the reduction of its structural interest rate. The Committee will continue to reassess the estimates of this rate over time.
21. The Committee members then discussed the monetary policy decision, in light of the evolution of the baseline scenario and the balance of risks since its September meeting (217th meeting). They unanimously decided to maintain the Selic rate at 6.50% p.a. 
22. The Copom then discussed the advisability of signaling the future evolution of monetary policy. Despite the reduction in the degree of asymmetry of the balance of risks, all members considered that the current environment prescribes retaining greater flexibility in the conduct of monetary policy, which requires refraining from providing indications of the next steps of monetary policy. The members of the Copom reinforced the importance of emphasizing their commitment to conducting monetary policy in order to maintain the path for prospective inflation in line with inflation targets. This requires flexibility to gradually adjust the conduct of monetary policy when and if needed. This ability to respond to different circumstances contributes to the maintenance of the environment with anchored expectations, which is fundamental to ensure that the achievement of low inflation persists, even in face of adverse shocks. 
23. The Committee members reiterated their preference for communicating the conditionalities for the conduct of monetary policy, which better transmits the economic rationality guiding their decisions. This contributes to increase transparency and enhance Copom?s communications. In this context, they reasserted that the next steps in the conduct of monetary policy will continue to depend on the evolution of economic activity, the balance of risks, and on inflation projections and expectations. 
24. All Committee members once again emphasized that the approval and implementation of reforms ? notably those of fiscal nature? and adjustments in the Brazilian economy are crucial for the sustainability of the environment of low and stable inflation, for the full operation of monetary policy, and for the reduction of the structural interest rate of the economy, with widespread benefits for society. The Committee also notes that the perception of continuity in the reform agenda affects expectations and current macroeconomic projections. 
25. Finally, the Copom members stressed the importance of other initiatives aimed at productivity increases, efficiency gains, greater flexibility of the economy, and improvements in the business environment. These efforts are fundamental for the resumption of economic activity and for the development of the Brazilian economy. 
26. Taking into account the baseline scenario, the balance of risks, and the wide array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to maintain the Selic rate at 6.50% p.a. The Committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective inflation and the associated balance of risks and is consistent with convergence of inflation to target over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy, which includes 2019 and, with a smaller weight, 2020. 
27. The Copom emphasizes that the evolution of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy is essential to maintain low inflation in the medium and long run, for the reduction of its structural interest rate, and for sustainable economic recovery. The Committee stresses that the perception of continuation of the reform agenda affects current expectations and macroeconomic projections. 
28. The Copom judges that it should base its decisions on the evolution of inflation projections and expectations, of the balance of risks, and of economic activity. Shocks that produce relative price changes should only lead to a monetary policy response to their possible second-round effects (i.e., to the propagation to prices in the economy that are not directly affected by the shock). It is through such second-round effects that these shocks may affect inflation projections and expectations, and change the balance of risks. These effects may be mitigated by the level of economic slack and by inflation expectations anchored at the targets. Therefore, there is no mechanical relationship between recent shocks and the conduct of monetary policy. 
29. The Copom reiterates that economic conditions still prescribe stimulative monetary policy, i.e., interest rates below the structural level. This stimulus will begin to be removed gradually if the outlook for inflation at the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy and/or its balance of risks worsen. 
30. In the Copom?s assessment, the evolution of the baseline scenario and of the balance of risks prescribes keeping the Selic rate at its current level. The Copom emphasizes that the next steps in the conduct of monetary policy will continue to depend on the evolution of economic activity, the balance of risks, and on inflation projections and expectations.
"
18/12/2018;219;Ilan Goldfajn;"1. Recent data on economic activity continue to indicate gradual recovery of the Brazilian economy. 
2. The economy continues to operate with a high level of economic slack, as reflected in the low industrial capacity utilization indexes and, mainly, in the unemployment rate. 
3. The global outlook remains challenging for emerging economies. The main risks are associated with an increase in risk aversion in global financial markets, with normalization of interest rates in some advanced economies, and with uncertainty regarding global trade. 
4. Various measures of underlying inflation are running at appropriate or comfortable levels. This includes the components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary policy. 
5. Inflation expectations for 2018, 2019 and 2020 collected by the Focus survey are around 3.7%, 4.1% and 4.0%, respectively. Expectations for 2021 are around 3.75%. 
6. The Copom's inflation projections in the scenario with interest rate and exchange rate paths extracted from the Focus survey stand around 3.7% for 2018, 3.9% for 2019, and 3.6% for 2020. This scenario assumes, among other assumptions, a path for the Selic rate that ends 2018 at 6.5% p.a., increases to 7.5% p.a. over the course of 2019, and reaches 8.0% p.a. by 2020. It also assumes a path for the exchange rate that ends 2018 at R$/US$ 3.78, and ends both 2019 and 2020 at R$/US$ 3.80. In this scenario, inflation projections for administered prices are 6.1% for 2018, 5.1% for 2019 and 3.9% for 2020. 
7. In the scenario with a constant Selic rate at 6.50% p.a., and a constant exchange rate at R$3.85/US$2, Copom?s inflation projections stand around 3.7% for 2018, 4.0% for 2019, and 4.0% for 2020. In this scenario, inflation projections for administered prices are 6.1% for 2018, 5.2% for 2019, and 4.0% for 2020. 
8. The Copom?s baseline scenario for inflation encompasses risk factors in both directions, but with larger weight on the last two risks, listed below. 
9. On the one hand, (i) the high level of economic slack may lead to a lower-than-expected prospective inflation trajectory. 
10. On the other hand, (ii) frustration of expectations regarding the continuation of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy may affect risk premia and increase the path for inflation over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy. This risk intensifies in case (iii) the global outlook for emerging economies deteriorates. 
11. The Committee judges that risk (i) has increased, whereas risk (ii) has moderated. 
12. The Committee members discussed the evolution of economic activity in light of available data. They concluded that the data indicate continuation of the gradual recovery of economic activity in Brazil. 
13. Regarding the global outlook, the Committee members considered that it remains challenging for emerging economies. They recognized the continuity of greater volatility in the prices of risky assets and debated the possible negative effects of increased risk aversion in global markets. The Copom?s baseline scenario assumes gradual normalization of monetary policy in some central economies. The Committee members also mentioned the uncertainty associated to the continued expansion of international trade, with possible impacts on global growth, and on the Chinese economy, in particular. In this context, the Copom members once again highlighted the capacity of the Brazilian economy to withstand a setback in the international scenario, given its robust balance of payments and the environment of anchored inflation expectations and prospects of economic recovery. 
14. The members of the Committee discussed the drop in recent inflation projections and the levels of various  measures of underlying inflation. They assessed that those measures are at appropriate or comfortable levels, and that inflation projections indicate convergence of inflation to target over the course of 2019 and 2020. This path is consistent with inflation expectations, which remain anchored. The Copom members emphasized, however, the existence of risks to the consolidation of this scenario in the medium and long terms, especially those related to the continuation of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy.
15. The Copom assessed that, since its previous meeting, the risk that the high level of economic slack may lead to a lower-than-expected prospective inflation trajectory has increased, while the risk related to the frustration of expectations regarding the continuation of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy has decreased. However, the members highlighted that upside risks to inflation remain significant, and with larger weight in their balance of risks. Therefore, the Committee concluded that the balance of risks remains asymmetric, albeit to a lesser degree. 
16. The Copom members assessed that economic conditions with anchored inflation expectations, underlying inflation measures at appropriate or comfortable levels, inflation projected to move toward targets for 2019 and 2020, and high level of slack in the economy prescribe accommodative monetary policy, i.e., interest rates below the structural interest rate level. Although estimates of this rate involve a high degree of uncertainty, the Committee members expressed the view that the current ex-ante real interest rates provide stimulus to the economy. 
17. The Committee also discussed the conditionalities that would prescribe accommodative monetary policy. All members agreed that the appropriate level of stimulus depends on economic conditions, inflation expectations, balance of risks and inflation projections. Importantly, the provision of monetary stimulus requires an environment with anchored inflation expectations. 
18. The Copom stresses that the continuation of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy is essential to the reduction of its structural interest rate. The Committee will continue to reassess the estimates of this rate over time. 
19. The Committee members then discussed the monetary policy decision, in light of the evolution of the baseline scenario and the balance of risks since its October meeting (218th meeting). They unanimously decided to maintain the Selic rate at 6.50% p.a. 
20. The Copom then discussed the advisability of signaling the future evolution of monetary policy. All members considered that the current environment prescribes retaining greater flexibility in the conduct of monetary policy, which requires refraining from providing indications of its next steps. The members of the Copom reinforced the importance of emphasizing their commitment to conducting monetary policy in order to maintain the path for prospective inflation in line with inflation targets. 
21. The Committee members reiterated their preference for communicating the conditionalities for the conduct of monetary policy, which better transmits the economic rationality guiding their decisions. This contributes to increase transparency and enhance Copom?s communications. In this context, they reasserted that the next steps in the conduct of monetary policy will continue to depend on the evolution of economic activity, the balance of risks, and on inflation projections and expectations. 
22. The Copom pondered that caution, serenity, and perseverance in monetary policy decisions, even in the face of volatile scenarios, have been instrumental in pursuing its primary objective of keeping the inflation path towards the targets. The Committee understands that decisions governed by these principles provide good guidance for monetary policy. 
23. All Committee members once again emphasized that the approval and implementation of reforms ?notably those of fiscal nature? and adjustments in the Brazilian economy are crucial for the sustainability of the environment of low and stable inflation, for the full operation of monetary policy, and for the reduction of the structural interest rate of the economy, with widespread benefits for society. The Committee also notes that the perception of continuity in the reform agenda affects expectations and current macroeconomic projections. 
24. Finally, the Copom members stressed the importance of other initiatives aimed at productivity increases, efficiency gains, greater flexibility of the economy, and improvements in the business environment. These efforts are fundamental for the resumption of economic activity and the development of the Brazilian economy. 
25. Taking into account the baseline scenario, the balance of risks, and the wide array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to maintain the Selic rate at 6.50% p.a. The Committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective inflation and the associated balance of risks, and is consistent with convergence of inflation to target over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy, which includes 2019 and, with a smaller weight, 2020.

The Copom emphasizes that the evolution of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy is essential to maintain low inflation in the medium and long run, for the reduction of its structural interest rate, and for sustainable economic recovery. The Committee stresses that the perception of continuation of the reform agenda affects current expectations and macroeconomic projections. 
28. In the Copom?s assessment, the evolution of the baseline scenario and the balance of risks prescribes keeping the Selic rate at its current level. The Copom emphasizes that the next steps in the conduct of monetary policy will continue to depend on the evolution of economic activity, the balance of risks, and inflation projections and expectations.

12/02/2019;220;Ilan Goldfajn;"1. Recent data on economic activity continue to indicate a gradual recovery of the Brazilian economy. 
2. The economy continues to operate with a high level of economic slack, as reflected in the low industrial capacity utilization indexes and, mainly, in the unemployment rate. 
3. The global outlook remains challenging, despite some decline in risks and a change in composition. On the one hand, short-term risks associated with the normalization of interest rates in some advanced economies have receded. On the other hand, there was an increase in risks related to a slowdown in global growth, as a result of several uncertainties, such as trade conflicts and Brexit.
4. Various measures of underlying inflation are running at appropriate or comfortable levels. This includes the components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary policy. 
5. Inflation expectations for 2019, 2020 and 2021 collected by the Focus survey are around 3.9%, 4.0% and 3.75%, respectively. 
6. Copom's inflation projections in the scenario with Selic rate and exchange rate paths extracted from the Focus survey stand at around 3.9% for 2019 and 3.8% for 2020. This scenario assumes, among other hypotheses, a path for the Selic rate that ends 2019 at 6.50% p.a. and increases to 8.00% p.a. over the course of 2020. It also assumes a path for the exchange rate that ends 2019 at R$3.70/US$, and 2020 at R$3.75/US$. In this scenario, inflation projections for administered prices are 5.1% for 2019, and 4.7% for 2020. 
7. In the scenario with a constant Selic rate at 6.50% p.a., and a constant exchange rate at R$3.70/US$2, Copom?s inflation projections stand around, 3.9% for 2019, and 4.0% for 2020. In this scenario, inflation projections for administered prices are 5.1% for 2019, and 4.5% for 2020. 
8. The Copom?s baseline scenario for inflation encompasses risk factors in both directions, but with larger weight on the last two risks below, thus with asymmetry. 
9. On the one hand, (i) the high level of economic slack may lead to a lower-than-expected prospective inflation trajectory. 
10. On the other hand, (ii) frustration of expectations regarding the continuation of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy may affect risk premia and increase the path of inflation over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy. This risk intensifies in case (iii) the global outlook for emerging economies deteriorates. 
11. The Committee judges that, since its previous meeting, notably related to the global outlook, inflationary risks have moderated. 
12. The Committee members discussed the evolution of economic activity in light of economic indicators and available data. In particular, the members discussed evidence of some slowdown in activity in the fourth quarter of 2018, when compared to the previous quarter. Taking into account the shocks that occurred during 2018, they concluded that the evolution of the economic activity is consistent with the Copom?s baseline scenario of a gradual recovery of the Brazilian economy. 
13. The Copom members pointed out that an acceleration in the pace of the economic recovery will depend on the decrease in uncertainties regarding the approval and implementation of reforms?notably those of fiscal nature?and adjustments in the Brazilian economy. They also stressed the importance of other initiatives aimed at productivity increases, efficiency gains, greater flexibility of the economy, and improvements in the business environment. These efforts are fundamental for the resumption of economic activity and the development of the Brazilian economy. 
14. Regarding the global outlook, the Committee members considered that it remains challenging, despite some decline in risks and a change in composition. The Committee discussed the contrasting scenarios for the evolution of the US economy. The first possible scenario?which seems to have affected the US yield curve and stock markets in the last months of 2018?involves risk of a significant economic slowdown. The second scenario assumes continuity of the vigorous economic growth. The two scenarios have opposite effects on the conduct of the monetary policy by the Fed. Copom members concluded that, at least until one of the scenarios becomes more likely, risks associated with the normalization of monetary policy in the US have reduced. In addition, they recognized that, given the slowdown in activity in some relevant economies, the risks associated with a weakening in the global economy have intensified. The Committee also noted that uncertainties, such as those associated with the continued expansion of international trade and Brexit, could contribute to lower overall growth. In this context, the Copom members once again highlighted the capacity of the Brazilian economy to withstand a setback in the international scenario, given its robust balance of payments and the environment of anchored inflation expectations and prospects of economic recovery. 
15. The members of the Committee discussed the recent inflation projections and the levels of various measures of underlying inflation. They assessed that those measures are at appropriate or comfortable levels, and that inflation projections indicate a convergence of inflation to target over the course of 2019 and 2020. This path is consistent with inflation expectations, which remain anchored. The Copom members emphasized, however, that the consolidation of this scenario in the medium and long terms depends on the pace of necessary reforms and adjustments in the Brazilian economy. 
16. The Committee members judged that inflationary risks ?notably those related to the global outlook? have moderated since their last previous meeting. However, the members highlighted that upside risks to inflation remain significant, and with larger weight on their balance of risks. Therefore, the Committee concluded that the balance of risks remains asymmetric, albeit to a lesser degree. 
17. The members of the Committee discussed the best way monetary policy should be conducted in the face of uncertainties regarding economic scenarios. They concluded that caution, serenity, and perseverance in monetary policy decisions, even in the face of volatile scenarios, is the best way to keep inflation on path towards the targets. 
18. The Copom members assessed that economic conditions with anchored inflation expectations, underlying inflation measures at appropriate or comfortable levels, inflation projected to move toward targets for 2019 and 2020, and high level of slack in the economy prescribe accommodative monetary policy, i.e., interest rates below the structural interest rate level. Although estimates of this rate involve a high degree of uncertainty, the Committee members expressed the view that the current ex-ante real interest rates provide stimulus to the economy.

The Committee stresses that the perception of continuation of the reform agenda affects current expectations and macroeconomic projections. 
25. Taking into account the baseline scenario, the balance of risks, and the wide array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to maintain the Selic rate at 6.50% p.a. The Committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective inflation and the associated balance of risks, and is consistent with the convergence of inflation to target over the horizon relevant for the conduct of monetary policy, which includes 2019 and, with a smaller and gradually increasing weight, 2020.

17/12/2019;227;Roberto Campos Neto;"1. Economic activity data as of the second quarter indicate that the recovery process of the Brazilian economy picked up relative to the first quarter of 2019. Copom's baseline scenario assumes that this recovery will occur at a gradual pace. 
2. Data suggest that the economy continues to operate with a high level of economic slack, as reflected in the low readings of traditional measures of industrial capacity utilization and, mainly, in the unemployment rate. 
3. Regarding the global outlook, the provision of monetary stimulus in major economies, in a context of below-target inflation, has been able to generate a relatively favorable environment for emerging economies. 
4. Various measures of underlying inflation are running at comfortable levels, including the components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary policy. 
5. Inflation expectations for 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 collected by the Focus survey are around 3.8%, 3.6%, 3.75%, and 3.5%, respectively. 
6. The Copom's inflation projections in the scenario with interest rate and exchange rate paths extracted from the Focus survey stand around 4.0% for 2019, 3.5% for 2020, and 3.4% for 2021. This scenario assumes a path for the Selic rate that ends 2019 at 4.50% p.a., falls to 4.25% p.a. at the beginning of 2020, ends that year at 4.50% p.a., and rises to 6.25% p.a. in 2021. It also assumes a path for the exchange rate that ends 2019 at R$4.15/US$, 2020 at R$4.10/US$ and 2021 at R$4.00/US$. In this scenario, inflation projections for administered prices are 5.1% for 2019, 3.6% for 2020, and 3.5% for 2021. 
7. The hybrid scenario with a constant exchange rate at R$4.20/US$2 and the interest rate path from the Focus survey yields inflation projections around 4.0% for 2019, 3.7% for 2020, and 3.7% for 2021. In this scenario, inflation projections for administered prices are 5.1% for 2019, 3.9% for 2020, and 4.1% for 2021. 
8. The Copom?s baseline scenario for inflation encompasses risk factors in both directions. 
9. On the one hand, (i) the high level of economic slack may continue to produce a lower-than-expected prospective inflation trajectory. 
10. On the other hand, (ii) in the context of changes in financial intermediation, the current degree of monetary stimulus, which affects the economy with lags, increases the uncertainty about the transmission channels and may raise the path for inflation over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy. Risk (ii) intensifies in case of (iii) a deterioration of the outlook for emerging economies or (iv) a possible frustration regarding the continuation of reforms and the perseverance in the necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy. 
11. Copom members discussed the evolution of economic activity in light of the available information and indicators. They concluded that data released since their previous meeting suggest that the Brazilian economy growth has picked up. Subsequent quarters should show some acceleration, which should be reinforced by the stimuli resulting from the release of FGTS and PIS-PASEP resources ? impacting mainly the last quarter of 2019. Copom?s baseline inflation scenario assumes that the pace of underlying economic activity growth ? which excludes the effects of temporary stimuli ? will be gradual. 
12. Copom members also evaluated the evolution of financial conditions indicators. They concluded that the conditions are favorable, despite some volatility inherent to those measures. The environment with favorable financial conditions results from the increase in the degree of monetary stimulus, the relatively favorable external environment for emerging economies and the prospects for improving the fundamentals of the Brazilian economy, as a result of the reform agenda and necessary adjustments. This easing of financial conditions has been more clearly reflected in the dynamics of non-earmarked credit and capital markets, which are growing at robust rates in this stage of the economic cycle. Some Copom members pointed out that there is evidence of the beginning of a gradual process of financial disintermediation. 
13. The Committee also discussed the characteristics of the current business cycle, with a smaller role for the public sector in the economy, and its possible implications for monetary policy. Some Copom members pointed out that changes in the credit market and financial intermediation, such as the greater role played by non-earmarked credit and capital markets, may have an impact on the monetary policy transmission channel. Copom members also conjectured about the sensitivity of macroeconomic variables to monetary policy, since there are no historical precedents in the Brazilian history for the current degree of stimulus. Copom members judge that changes in the credit and capital markets tend to bolster the power of monetary policy. 
14. Copom members also reflected on the level of economic slack. Some members argued that the latest activity data and the greater efficiency of the credit and capital markets may result in a faster decline in economic slack than anticipated, and thus produce upward pressure on inflation. On the other hand, the members of the Committee stressed that the dynamics of the inflation cores measures indicate that the level of economic slack is still high. 
15. Regarding the global outlook, the Committee members deemed the scenario as relatively favorable for emerging economies. Central banks of several economies ? some major economies included ? have provided monetary stimuli, which contribute to easing global financial conditions. 
16. In the relevant horizon for monetary policy, the scenario with the interest rate path from the Focus survey and a constant exchange rate results in inflation slightly below the 2020 target and around the 2021 target. Short-term projections were particularly affected by the effects of the proteins price shock, which occurred more intensely and earlier than anticipated. The projections consider a direct effect more concentrated in the last two months of this year, constituting the main factor that increased 2019 projections. Regarding administered prices, benign conditions for the occurrence of minor adjustments in electricity rates were mentioned. This process has been occurring in recent months and will probably continue over the next quarters. 
17. The Copom members assessed that the economic conditions with anchored inflation expectations, underlying inflation measures at comfortable levels, scenarios with projected inflation below or around target for the relevant horizon of monetary policy, and the high level of slack in the economy prescribe stimulative monetary policy, i.e., interest rates below the structural level. The Committee members expressed the view that the current level of ex-ante real interest rates provides stimulus to the economy. 
18. Taking into account the baseline scenario, the balance of risks, and the broad array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to lower the Selic rate by 0.5 percentage point, to 4.50% p.a. The Committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective inflation and the associated balance of risks, and it is consistent with convergence of inflation to its target over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy, which includes 2020 and, to a lesser extent, 2021. 
19. The Copom reiterates that economic conditions prescribe stimulative monetary policy, i.e., interest rates below the structural level. 
20. The Copom sees progress in the process of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy. The Committee emphasizes that persevering in this process is essential to allow for the consolidation of the reduction of the structural interest rate and for a sustainable economic recovery. The Committee stresses that the perception of the continuation of the reform agenda affects current expectations and macroeconomic projections. 
21. The Copom judges that the current stage of the business cycle recommends caution in the conduct of monetary policy. The Copom emphasizes that its next steps will continue to depend on the evolution of economic activity, the balance of risks, and inflation projections and expectations.

11/02/2020;228;Roberto Campos Neto;"1. Data on economic activity released since the previous meeting indicate the continuation of the process of gradual economic recovery. 
2. Regarding the global outlook, despite the recent increase in uncertainty, the provision of monetary stimulus in major economies has been able to generate relatively favorable environment for emerging economies. 
3. The Committee judges that various measures of underlying inflation are running at levels compatible with meeting the inflation target at the relevant horizon for monetary policy. 
4. Inflation expectations for 2020, 2021 and 2022 collected by the Focus survey are around 3.4%, 3.75% and 3.5%, respectively. 
5. The hybrid scenario with a constant exchange rate at R$4.25/US$2and the interest rate path from the Focus survey yields inflation projections around 3.5% for 2020 and 3.7% for 2021. This scenario assumes a path for the Selic rate that ends 2020 at 4.25% p.a. and rises to 6.00% p.a. in 2021. In this scenario, inflation projections for administered prices are 3.7% for 2020 and 4.1% for 2021. 
6. The scenario with constant interest rate at 4.50% p.a. and constant exchange rate at R$4.25/US$2, yields inflation projections around 3.5% for 2020, and 3.8% for 2021. In this scenario, inflation projections for administered prices are 3.7% for 2020 and 4.1% for 2021.

On the other hand, (ii) the current degree of monetary stimulus, which affects the economy with lags, may produce a higher-than-expected path for inflation over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy. Risk (ii) intensifies in case of (iii) an increase in the monetary policy power due to the changes in financial intermediation and in credit and capital markets, (iv) a deterioration of the outlook for emerging economies, or (v) a possible frustration with the continuation of reforms and the perseverance in the necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy. 
10. Copom members discussed the evolution of economic activity in light of available information and indicators. They assessed that the data released since their previous meeting indicatea dichotomy between labor market developments and growth in the production of goods and services. While the labor market continues to recover gradually, recent industrial production data and preliminary investment indicators have performed worse than expected. 
11. In this context, Copom members also discussed the size of the economic slack. Some members assessed that the exhaustion of the centralized capital allocation model and the long duration of the recession may have produced supply constraints. In this context, the aforementioned dichotomy suggests that there may be less economic slack than that measured by traditional methods. 
12. Other members stressed that the dynamics of the core inflation, despite the recent effects of the protein price shock, signals that the economic slack is still large. 
13. Copom members also evaluated the evolution of financial conditions indicators. They concluded that the conditions are favorable, despite some volatility inherent to those measures. The environment with benign financial conditions results from the increase in the degree of monetary stimulus, the relatively favorable global environment for emerging economies and the prospects for the economics fundamentals in the Brazilian economy, as a result of the reform agenda and necessary adjustments. 
14. The Committee also discussed the characteristics of the current business cycle, with smaller role for the government in the economy, and its possible implications for monetary policy. Some Copom members pointed out that changes in credit markets and financial intermediation, such as the greater role played by non-earmarked credit and capital markets, must have an impact on the transmission channel of monetary policy. Copom members also conjectured on the sensitivity of macroeconomic variables to monetary policy, as we lack historical precedent in the Brazilian history for the current degree of stimulus. Copom members judge that changes in the credit and capital markets tend to bolster the power of monetary policy. 
15. Regarding the global outlook, Committee members deemed the scenario relatively favorable for emerging economies. The Committee discussed the effects of the coronavirus on the global economy. A prolongation or intensification of the outbreak would imply an additional deceleration of global growth, with impacts on commodity prices and important financial assets. The Copom members concluded that the consequence of these effects to monetary policy conduct will depend on the relative magnitude of the global economic slowdown versus the reaction of financial assets. 
16. In the relevant horizon for monetary policy, the scenario with the interest rate path from the Focus survey and the constant exchange rate results in inflation below the 2020 target and around the 2021 target. Short-term projections were particularly affected by the effects of the protein price shock which, after manifesting themselves more intensely than expected at the end of 2019, have already showed a partial reversal at the beginning of 2020. Regarding administered prices, the benign conditions for the occurrence of minor adjustments in electricity rates persist. 
17. The Copom members assessed that the economic conditions with anchored inflation expectations, underlying inflation measures at levels compatible with meeting the inflation target, scenarios with projected inflation below or around the target for the relevant horizon of monetary policy, and elevated economic slack prescribe stimulative monetary policy, i.e., interest rates below the structural level. The Committee members expressed the view that the current level of ex-ante real interest rates provides stimulus to the economy. 
18. However, given the multiple uncertainties regarding the current size of economic slack, the speed of economic recovery, and the increase in the power of monetary policy, which acts with lags in the economy, the Copom considers that it is important to observe the effects of the monetary stimulus cycle that started in 2019. The Committee judges that a better understanding of these effects is essential to determine the next steps in monetary policy. 
19. The Committee believes that, in a context of anchored inflation expectations, the protein prices shock antecipated inflation from 2020 to 2019. Given that there are uncertainties regarding the lag and the magnitude of the effects of the stimulus already granted, the Copom believes that it is essential to observe the evolution of economic activity and inflation projections and expectations over the next months, with increasing weight for 2021. 
20. Taking into account the baseline scenario, the balance of risks, and the broad array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to lower the Selic rate by 0.25 percentage point to 4.25% p.a. The Committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective inflation and the associated balance of risks, and it is consistent with convergence of inflation to its target over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy, which includes 2020 and, with increasing weight, 2021. 
21. The Copom reiterates that economic conditions prescribe stimulative monetary policy, i.e., interest rates below the structural level. 
22. The Copom sees progress in the process of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy but emphasizes that persevering in this process is essential to allow for the consolidation of the reduction of the structural interest rate and for a sustainable economic recovery. The Committee also stresses that the perception of continuation of the reform agenda affects current expectations and macroeconomic projections. 
23. The Copom judges that the current stage of the business cycle recommends caution in the conduct of monetary policy. In light of the lagged effects of the monetary easing cycle that began in July 2019, the Committee deems appropriate to interrupt the monetary easing process. The Committee emphasizes that its next steps will continue to depend on the evolution of economic activity, the balance of risks, and inflation projections and expectations, with increasing weight for 2021.

23/03/2020;229;Roberto Campos Neto;"1. Regarding the global outlook, the novel coronavirus pandemic is causing a significant global growth slowdown, a fall in commodity prices, and an increase in asset prices volatility. With this background, the environment for emerging economies has become challenging, despite the additional provision of monetary stimulus in major economies. 
2. Data on economic activity released since the previous meeting remains in line with the process of the gradual recovery of the Brazilian economy. However, these data do not yet reflect the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
3. Several measures of underlying inflation are running at levels compatible with meeting the inflation target at the relevant horizon for monetary policy. 
4. Short-term projections have been significantly affected by recent commodity price movements. In particular, the substantial international oil price retraction may quickly affect domestic fuel prices. The implications of the pandemic on the service segment, notably on airfare prices, are likely to be reflected in the monthly inflation readings, mainly from May onwards. 
5. Inflation expectations for 2020, 2021 and 2022 collected by the Focus survey are around 3.1%, 3.65% and 3.5%, respectively. 
6. In the hybrid scenario with interest rate path extracted from the Focus survey and constant exchange rate at R$4.75/US$2, projections stand around 3.0% for 2020, and 3.6% for 2021. This scenario assumes a path for the Selic rate that ends 2020 at 3.75% p.a. and rises to 5.25% p.a. in 2021. In this scenario, inflation projections for administered prices are 1.5% for 2020 and 3.9% for 2021. 
7. The scenario with constant interest rate at 4.25% p.a. and constant exchange rate at R$4.75/US$ yields inflation projections around 3.0% for 2020, and 3.6% for 2021. In this scenario, inflation projections for administered prices are 1.5% for 2020 and 3.9% for 2021. 
8. The Copom?s baseline scenario for inflation encompasses risk factors in both directions. 
9. On the one hand, economic slack may continue to produce a lower-than-expected prospective inflation trajectory. This risk increases if a worsening of the pandemic implies a larger-than-expected, both in magnitude and in length, increase in uncertainty and decline in demand. 
10. On the other hand, the increase in monetary policy power, the deterioration of the external scenario, or the frustration with the continuation of reforms may increase the risk premium and generate a higher-than-expected path for inflation over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy. 
11. Copom members discussed the evolution of economic activity in light of the available information and indicators. They assessed that the data released since their previous meeting were in line with expectations. However, these data do not yet reflect the impacts of the pandemic in the Brazilian economy, hence, they should have little relevance to prospective analysis. 
12. The Copom members continued the debate on the size of the economic slack. Given the available data, the Copom concluded that the economy continued to recover gradually and close its gap. However, in the current context of the pandemic, measures of economic slack have become dated. 
13. The Committee understands that the available information is enough to demonstrate that the pandemic will have an extremely significant contractionary effect on global activity. The fiscal and monetary measures adopted by the main economies tend to mitigate only a small share of these effects. Regarding emerging countries, the outlook has quickly changed from favorable to challenging. As in other international crises, the increase in risk aversion and the resulting reallocation of assets are causing a substantial tightening of financial conditions. 
14. The Committee then discussed how the pandemic affects the Brazilian economy and, particularly, the scenarios for prospective inflation. The Copom 
that there are three main transmission channels. First, a supply shock, derived from the interruption of production chains. Second, a production costs shock, measured by the commodity price variation and important financial assets. Third, a shortage of demand, derived from an increased uncertainty and the restrictions imposed by the pandemic. 
15. The Committee judges that the first effect will have small quantitative importance, due to the Brazilian economy's poor interconnection with global production chains. The second effect will probably imply a strong disinflationary impact in the short term. However, its importance should be put into perspective due to its temporary nature and to the volatility of commodity prices measured in local currency. Finally, the third effect tends to be quite significant at the relevant horizon for monetary policy because the effects of the pandemic on activity could be substantial. According to simulations presented at the Copom meeting, to offset this third effect, it would be necessary to reduce the policy rate by more than 0.50 percentage point. 
16. The Copom conjectured on the economy's structural interest rate and how it may evolve in the coming months. In the Committee's view, the possible interaction between the deterioration of the external scenario, the frustrations regarding the continuity of the reforms and the possible permanent changes in the public accounts adjustment process, may threaten the fall in structural interest rates observed in recent years. 
17. In light of this perception, the Committee considered that a reduction in the basic interest rate beyond 0.50 percentage point could become counterproductive and could result in tighter financial conditions, thus leading to the opposite desired effect. Based on the information available so far, the Committee sees the maintenance of the Selic rate at its new level as appropriate. However, the Committee recognizes that new information on economic conditions will be essential to determine its next steps. 
18. The Copom members also discussed the effectiveness of monetary policy to stimulate demand. They concluded that, although limited so far, the effects will become relevant for accelerating economic recovery when the restrictions imposed by the pandemic start to be lifted. 
19. Finally, the Copom evaluated the balance of risks around the baseline scenario. The Committee concluded that, at the moment, the balance of risks has higher variance than usual. In the Committee's view, the greater variance in the balance of risks does not necessarily imply gradualism in the conduct of monetary policy, but that the magnitude of forthcoming monetary policy decisions is subject to greater uncertainty. 
20. Taking into account the baseline scenario, the balance of risks, and the broad array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to lower the Selic rate by 0.50 percentage point to 3.75% p.a. The Committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective inflation, a higher-than-usual variance in the balance of risks, and it is consistent with convergence of inflation to its target over the relevant horizon, which includes 2020 and, mainly, 2021. 
21. The Copom reiterates that economic conditions prescribe stimulative monetary policy, i.e., interest rates below the structural level. 
22. The Committee emphasizes that persevering in the process of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy is essential for a sustainable economic recovery. The Copom also stresses that questions about the continuation of the reform agenda and permanent changes to the fiscal consolidation process could result in a higher structural interest rate. Under such circumstances, additional monetary easing may be counterproductive and result in tighter financial conditions. 
23. The Copom understands that the current environment recommends caution in the conduct of monetary policy and, at this moment, deems appropriate to keep the Selic rate at its new level. However, the Committee recognizes that the variance of its balance of risks has increased and that further economic data will be essential to determine its next steps. 
24. The Banco Central do Brasil stresses that it will continue to deploy its arsenal of monetary, exchange rate and financial stability policies to fight the current crisis.
"
12/05/2020;230;Roberto Campos Neto;"1. Regarding the global outlook, the COVID-19 pandemic is causing a significant slowdown in global growth, a fall in commodity prices, and an increase in asset prices volatility. Against this backdrop, despite the additional provision of fiscal and monetary stimuli in major economies, and some moderation in financial assets volatility, the environment for emerging economies remains challenging, with capital outflows significantly larger than in previous episodes. 
2. Turning to economic activity, data through March reflect only partly the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic over the Brazilian economy. Higher frequency and more timely indicators for April show that the economic contraction will be significantly deeper than forecasted in the previous meeting. 
3. Several measures of underlying inflation are running below the levels compatible with meeting the inflation target at the relevant horizon for monetary policy. 
4. Inflation expectations for 2020, 2021, and 2022 collected by the Focus survey are around 2.0%, 3.3%, and 3.5%, respectively. 
5. Short-term projections have experienced relevant revisions and incorporate the prospect of significant deflation in the coming months. There was a further decline in oil prices and a sharp drop in domestic fuel prices for producers, which will continue to impact consumer prices in the coming weeks. The most recent readings of price indices showed significant disinflationary effects on prices of services and industrial goods. 
6. Inflation projections and scenarios are affected by assumptions about the future path of oil prices, which have oscillated at historically low levels due to an expansionary supply shock and, mainly, a fall in global demand. The following scenarios consider that Brent oil prices rise about 40% by the end of 2020, compared with the average prices of the week prior to the Copom meeting. 
7. In the hybrid scenario with interest rate path extracted from the Focus survey and constant exchange rate at R$5.55/US$2, the Copom projections stand around 2.4% for 2020 and 3.4% for 2021. This scenario assumes a path for the Selic rate that ends 2020 at 2.75% p.a. and rises to 3.75% p.a. in 2021. In this scenario, inflation projections for administered prices are 0.7% for 2020 and 3.9% for 2021. 
8. The scenario with constant interest rate at 3.75% p.a. and constant exchange rate at R$5.55/US$ yields inflation projections around 2.3% for 2020 and 3.2% for 2021. In this scenario, inflation projections for administered prices are 0.7% for 2020 and 3.8% for 2021. 
9. The Copom?s baseline scenario for inflation encompasses risk factors in both directions. 
10. On the one hand, economic slack may continue to produce a lower-than-expected prospective inflation trajectory. This risk increases if a worsening of the pandemic implies an increase in uncertainty and precautionary savings and, consequently, implies a decline in aggregate demand that is larger or longer than anticipated. 
11. On the other hand, fiscal policy responses to the pandemic that permanently aggravate the fiscal trajectory or a frustration with the continuation of the reform agenda may increase the risk premium and imply a higher-than-expected path for inflation over the relevant horizon for monetary policy. 
12. Regarding the global economy, the Copom judges that, as in previous international crises, the increase in risk aversion, and the consequent asset reallocation, make the environment more challenging for emerging economies. Unlike other recent crises, in which the epicenter was in the Northern Hemisphere, in the current crisis it moved to all countries, along with the pandemic. Additionally, projections point to a global recession with few historical precedents. These two factors help explain capital outflows significantly larger than in previous episodes. Among the emerging economies, those with greater fiscal vulnerability are prone to be the most harmed. 
13. The Copom members discussed the evolution of domestic economic activity in light of the available information and indicators. They assessed that, despite few data available for April, there is enough evidence that the economy will contract strongly during the second quarter of the year. The Committee also discussed on the pace of economic recovery. They considered that, unless there are medical advancements in the fight against the pandemic, it is plausible to consider a scenario in which the recovery is more gradual and marked by comings and goings. The baseline scenario assumes a sharp drop in GDP in the first half of the year, followed by a gradual recovery from the third quarter on. 
14. The Copom members debated about the level of economic slack. They reinforced their view that the pandemic shall exert a disinflationary impact on the Brazilian economy, together with a sharp increase in economic slack. The sudden growth in uncertainty among economic agents may result in an increase in precautionary savings and, consequently, a significant decline in aggregate demand. 
15. The Committee then discussed the potential existence of an effective lower bound for the Brazilian policy rate. Most members pondered that this limit would be significantly higher in emerging economies than in developed countries, due to a risk premium. It was also pointed out that this premium tends to be higher in Brazil, given the country's relative fiscal fragility and the uncertainties regarding its prospective fiscal path. In this context, we would be close to a level where further reductions in the policy rate could be accompanied by instability in financial markets and asset prices. Conversely, another member argued that, in principle, there is no reason for such a minimum operational limit, since traditional channels of monetary policy remain operational, without discontinuities, although possibly with an increased effect of changes in the policy rate on financial asset prices. The Committee as a whole recognized the importance of gradualism in the conduct of monetary policy for assessing the response of financial asset prices. 
16. Finally, concerning the structural rate of the economy, the Committee assessed that it also reflects economic agents? expectations about the prospective fiscal trajectory. In the Committee's view, the interaction between the deterioration of the external scenario, frustrations regarding the continuity of the reforms and possible permanent changes to the public accounts adjustment process may threaten the downward path of the structural interest rate. 
17. Conversely, the Copom recognizes that, at this moment, the demand-driven disinflationary shock, although accompanied by greater fiscal fragility, has triggered a downward revision on inflation expectations towards levels not compatible with the target, particularly, within the relevant horizon for monetary policy. This decline holds for expectations measured by both the Focus survey and the break-even inflation extracted from government debt securities. The Committee reaffirms its commitment to the inflation target set by the National Monetary Council, which has always been and still is the main objective of monetary policy. 
18. Two Committee members pondered that, even with the possibility of an increase in the structural rate, it could be appropriate to provide the overall monetary stimulus immediately, in combination with a guidance of keeping the interest rate constant for the next months, in order to reduce the probability of missing the inflation target for 2021. 
19. However, the prevalent view was that, in light of the elevated uncertainty domestically, the remaining scope for monetary policy is unknown and may be small. Therefore, the Copom chose to provide a more moderate stimulus, for the benefit of gathering more information until its next meeting. 
20. Taking into account the baseline scenario, the balance of risks, and the broad array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to lower the Selic rate by 0.75 percentage points to 3.00% p.a. The Committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective inflation, a higher-than-usual variance in the balance of risks, and it is consistent with convergence of inflation to its target over the relevant horizon for monetary policy, which includes 2021. 
21. The Committee believes that persevering in the process of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy is essential for a sustainable economic recovery. The Copom also stresses that doubts regarding the continuation of the reform agenda and permanent changes to the fiscal consolidation process could result in an increase in the structural interest rate. 
22. The Copom believes that the current state of affairs recommends an unusually large monetary stimulus, but it reinforces that there are potential limits to the remaining space for adjustment. The Committee believes that the fiscal trajectory over the next year, as well as the perception of its sustainability, will be crucial to determine the length of the stimulus. 
23. For the next meeting, conditional on the fiscal scenario and on the economic data, the Committee considers a final monetary adjustment, not larger than this one, to complete the change to the policy rate that it deems adequate to counteract the economic consequences from the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the Committee recognizes that the variance of its balance of risks has increased and that further information on the effects of the pandemic in the economy, as well as a decline in fiscal uncertainty, will be essential to determine its next steps.
"
23/06/2020;231;Roberto Campos Neto;"1. Regarding the global outlook, the COVID-19 pandemic keeps causing a significant slowdown in global growth. Against this backdrop, despite the additional provision of fiscal and monetary stimuli in major economies and some moderation in financial assets volatility, the environment for emerging economies remains challenging. 
2. Turning to economic activity, the first-quarter data release showed the largest GDP decline since 2015, reflecting the initial effects of the pandemic. Recent indicators suggest that the second-quarter economic activity contraction will be even larger. Prospectively, uncertainty about the second half-year economic recovery remains larger than usual. 
3. Several measures of underlying inflation are running below the levels compatible with meeting the inflation target at the relevant horizon for monetary policy. 
4. Inflation expectations for 2020, 2021, and 2022 collected by the Focus survey are around 1.6%, 3.0%, and 3.5%, respectively. 
5. Short-term inflation tends to increase, mainly reflecting the impacts of the reversal of international oil prices and of price adjustments of administered items that were postponed. 
6. In the hybrid scenario with interest rate path extracted from the Focus survey and constant exchange rate at R$4.95/US$2*, the Copom projections stand around 2.0% for 2020 and 3.2% for 2021. This scenario assumes a path for the Selic rate that ends 2020 at 2.25% p.a. and rises to 3.00% p.a. in 2021. In this scenario, inflation projections for administered prices are 1.3% for 2020 and 3.8% for 2021. 
7. The scenario with constant interest rate at 3.00% p.a. and constant exchange rate at R$4.95/US$ yields inflation projections around 1.9% for 2020, and 3.00% for 2021. In this scenario, inflation projections for administered prices are 1.3% for 2020 and 3.8% for 2021. 
8. The Copom?s baseline scenario for inflation encompasses risk factors in both directions. 
9. On the one hand, economic slack may continue to produce a lower-than-expected prospective inflation trajectory. This risk increases if a lengthening of the pandemic causes an increase in uncertainty and precautionary savings and, consequently, implies a decline in aggregate demand that is larger and longer than estimated. 
10. On the other hand, fiscal policy responses to the pandemic that permanently aggravate the fiscal path or a frustration with the continuation of the reform agenda may increase the risk premium. Additionally, the credit and transfer programs implemented in response to the pandemic may cause a smaller-than-estimated decline in aggregate demand, introducing an asymmetry to the balance of risks. This set of factors could potentially result in a higher-than-expected path for inflation over the relevant horizon for monetary policy. 
11. Regarding the global economy, the Committee pondered that governments and central banks of major economies reacted in an unprecedentedly coordinated and strong way, thus partially mitigating the economic impacts of the crisis. However, unlike other crises, the epicenter of the current crisis moved to all countries, along with the pandemic. Better monitoring, information, as well a larger pool of resources, allows developed countries to fight against the pandemic in a more vigorous and efficient manner than emerging economies. As a result, the sanitary and economic effects of the pandemic are larger in emerging economies, especially in those with limited fiscal space, which reflects on risk aversion and capital flows toward these countries. In this context, despite some moderation in the volatility of asset prices, the international environment for the Brazilian economy remains challenging. 
12. The Copom members discussed the evolution of domestic economic activity in light of the available information and indicators. They evaluated that data for the second quarter corroborate the perspective of a sharp GDP contraction and suggest that economic activity reached the lowest level in April, registering only a partial recovery in May and June. The Copomïs baseline scenario entails a sharp decline in GDP in the first half of this year, followed by a gradual recovery from the third quarter onwards. 
13. The Copom members debated on the level of economic slack. They reinforced their view that the pandemic shall exert a disinflationary impact on the Brazilian economy, together with a sharp increase in the level of economic slack. The sudden growth in economic uncertainty should result in an increase in precautionary savings and, consequently, a significant reduction of aggregate demand. 
14. The Committee also considered the impact of the credit and transfer programs on aggregate demand. The Committee assessed that these programs have the potential to complement a significant portion of the aggregate demand that would be lost due to the effects of the pandemic. As a result, the economic recovery could be faster than anticipated by the baseline scenario. 
15. The Committee resumed the discussion on the potential effective lower limit for the Brazilian interest rate. Most members of the Committee believe that this limit would be significantly higher among emerging economies than among developed countries, due to the existence of a risk premium. This premium is dynamic and tends to be larger in Brazil, given the country's relative fiscal fragility and the uncertainties regarding its prospective fiscal path. In this context, we would already be close to the level from which further interest rate reductions could be accompanied by asset price instability, and potentially compromise the performance of some markets and economic sectors. The Committee also reflected on the relative importance of the main components of the cost of credit and emphasized that liquidity premium seems to prevail at the moment. The Committee recognized that this set of factors, as well as prudential issues, justify caution in the conduct of monetary policy. 
16. Finally, the Copom judged that the demand-driven disinflationary shock, although accompanied by greater fiscal fragility, has triggered a downward revision on inflation expectations towards levels not compatible with the target, particularly, within the relevant horizon for monetary policy. Although this movement seems to have ceased in the expectations implicit in government bonds, it continues to occur in the expectations collected by the Focus survey. Therefore, the Committee keeps a close eye on revisions to the economic scenario and inflation expectations, and reaffirmed its commitment to the inflation target set by the National Monetary Council, which has always been and still is the main objective of monetary policy. 
17. Taking into account the baseline scenario, the balance of risks, and the broad array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to lower the Selic rate by 0.75 percentage point to 2.25% p.a. The Committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective inflation, a higher-than-usual variance in the balance of risks, and it is consistent with convergence of inflation to its target over the relevant horizon for monetary policy, which includes 2021. 
18. The Committee believes that persevering in the process of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy is essential for a sustainable economic recovery. The Copom also stresses that doubts regarding the continuation of the reform agenda and permanent changes to the fiscal consolidation process could result in an increase in the structural interest rate. 
19. The Copom believes that the current state of affairs continues to recommend an unusually strong monetary stimulus, but it recognizes that the remaining space for monetary policy stimulus is uncertain and should be small. The Committee believes that the fiscal trajectory over the next year, as well as the perception of its sustainability, will be crucial to determine the length of the stimulus. 
20. At the present moment, the Committee judges that the magnitude of the monetary stimulus already implemented seems compatible with the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. For the next meetings, the Committee sees as appropriate to evaluate the impact of the pandemic and of the set of credit and transfer programs in place and foresees that any possible adjustment to the monetary stimulus would be residual. However, the Copom remains attentive to revisions of the economic scenario and of the inflation expectations for the relevant horizon of monetary policy. The Committee recognizes that the variance of its balance of risks has increased and that further information on the evolution of the pandemic, as well as a decline in fiscal uncertainty, will be essential to determine its next steps.

11/08/2020;232;Roberto Campos Neto;"1. Regarding the global outlook, the Covid-19 pandemic keeps causing the largest economic downturn since the Great Depression. Against this backdrop, despite some promising signs of recovery in major economies, and some moderation in financial assets volatility, the environment for emerging economies remains challenging. 
2. Turning to the Brazilian economic activity, recent indicators suggest a partial recovery. Sectors more directly affected by social distancing measures remain depressed despite the offsetting effects of the government transfer programs. Prospectively, uncertainty about economic growth remains larger than usual, especially for the period starting at the end of this year, concurrently with the expected winding up of the emergency transfer programs. 
3. Various measures of underlying inflation remain below the level compatible with meeting the inflation target at the relevant horizon for monetary policy. 
4. Inflation expectations for 2020, 2021, and 2022 collected by the Focus survey are around 1.6%, 3.0%, and 3.5%, respectively. 
5. Short-term inflation seems to be cooling after July?s sharp increase. Relative to the previous Copom Meeting, short-term projections remain relatively stable. Revisions to some components of service price inflation have offset the impact of the depreciation of the Brazilian real and the rise in commodity prices. 
6. The Copom's inflation projections in the hybrid scenario with interest rate path extracted from the Focus survey and constant exchange rate at R$5.20/US$2 stand around 1.9% for 2020, 3.0% for 2021 and 3.4% for 2022. This scenario assumes a path for the Selic rate that ends 2020 at 2.0% p.a., rises to 3.0% p.a. in 2021 and 5.0% p.a. in 2022. In this scenario, inflation projections for administered prices are 1.6% for 2020, 3.4% for 2021, and 3.9% for 2022. 
7. The scenario with constant interest rate at 2.25% p.a. and constant exchange rate at R$5.20/US$ yields inflation projections around 1.9% for 2020, 3.0% for 2021 and 3.7% for 2022. In this scenario, inflation projections for administered prices are 1.6% for 2020, 3.4% for 2021, and 3.9% for 2022. 
8. The Committee emphasizes that risks to its baseline scenario remain in both directions. 
9. On the one hand, economic slack may continue to produce a lower-than-expected prospective inflation trajectory. This risk increases if a slower reversion of the pandemic effects lengthens the environment of high uncertainty and precautionary savings. 
10. On the other hand, fiscal policy responses to the pandemic that permanently aggravate the fiscal path or frustrations regarding the continuation of the reform agenda may increase the risk premium. Additionally, the credit and transfer programs implemented in response to the pandemic may cause a smaller-than-estimated decline in aggregate demand, introducing an asymmetry to the balance of risks. This set of factors could potentially result in a higher-than-expected path for inflation over the relevant horizon for monetary policy. 
11. Regarding the global economy, the data already available for the 2020Q2 GDP did not surprise, but it showed that the depth of the current economic downturn is only comparable to that of the Great Depression. There are some promising signs of recovery which, however, has shown to be incomplete. The strong recovery in consumption was not followed by the services sector. The Committee pondered that the main restriction to a full recovery in the major economies is the evolution of the pandemic itself, and the possibility of a second wave of the virus is a major risk. 
12. The Copom members discussed the evolution of domestic economic activity in light of the available information and indicators. They evaluated that recent data suggest a partial recovery of the economic activity. Government transfer programs have allowed for a relatively strong resumption of durable goods consumption and even of investment. However, several service sector activities, especially those most directly affected by social distancing measures, remain quite depressed. Looking forward, the poor predictability associated with the evolution of the pandemic and the necessary decline in emergency aid by the end of 2020 increase uncertainty about the speed of the economic recovery. The Committee considered that this unpredictability and the risks associated with the evolution of the pandemic may imply a domestic scenario characterized by an even more gradual recovery of the economy. 
13. The Copom members debated on the level of economic slack. As with the activity, the Committee believes that the pandemic should continue to have heterogeneous effects on the economic sectors. Given the nature of the shock, the service sector should continue to have a larger economic slack than other sectors. The Committee concluded that the nature of the crisis probably implies that the disinflationary pressures from reduced demand may last longer than in previous recessions. 
14. The Committee then assessed the appropriate degree of stimulus for the current environment. First, it analyzed whether the existence of an asymmetry in its balance of risks, mainly related to fiscal issues and the continuation of reforms in the Brazilian economy, would be a sufficient reason to maintain the stimulus at its current level. Given its perception of economic slack and prospective inflation, the Committee considered that, although asymmetric, its projections for inflation are below the target for the relevant horizon for monetary policy. Therefore, in line with its inflation targeting mandate, the Committee concluded that it would be appropriate to increase residually the degree of monetary stimulus. 
15. The Committee then resumed discussion of a potential effective lower limit for the Brazilian policy interest rate and its connection with prudential and financial stability issues. For the majority of the members of the Copom, this limit would be significantly higher among emerging economies than among developed countries due to the existence of a risk premium. This premium is dynamic and tends to be larger in Brazil, given the country's relative fiscal fragility and the uncertainties regarding its prospective fiscal path. In this context, we would already be close to the level from which further interest rate reductions could be accompanied by asset price instability. 
16. The Copom also discussed the relative importance of the main components of credit and operating costs of the financial system. Considering the long history of the Brazilian economy operating with the basic interest rate at a very high level, the unprecedented low interest rates may compromise the performance of some markets and economic sectors, with potential impact on financial intermediation. Based on results from stress test scenarios, the Committee considers that the financial system is resilient to the credit risk arising from the current pandemic. However, when analyzing the financial system in a broad way ? considering its various industries, markets, products and financial services ? the Committee reflected that an unprecedentedly low interest rate environment may generate increased asset price volatility. Moreover, without the necessary time to transition to a new environment, it may affect the proper functioning and dynamics of the financial system and the capital markets. Hence, the Committee concluded that possible new interest rates reductions would demand caution and additional gradualism. To this end, if necessary, further interest rate cuts would require greater clarity about prospective inflation and activity and could be spaced over time. 
17. In order to provide the monetary stimulus deemed adequate to meet the inflation target, but maintaining the necessary caution for prudential reasons, the Copom considered the use of a forward guidance as an additional monetary policy tool. The Copom discussed the limitations on the use of this instrument in emerging countries. Relative to developed countries, emerging countries are more susceptible to contagion from external crises and have greater vulnerabilities in their economic fundamentals. Therefore, due this greater unpredictability and volatility, the use of such an instrument becomes more challenging. The Committee concluded that despite those limitations, the forward guidance would be the policy strategy with the best cost-benefit ratio. The forward guidance transmits the Committee's vision on its future actions and tends to adjust the expectations reflected on the intermediary part of the yield curve. 
18. To adapt the forward guidance to the dynamic limits imposed by prudential issues, the Committee considered that it should have an asymmetric policy intention, in which, if the necessary conditions were met, the Copom would not raise the interest rate but could reduce it. To maximize its effectiveness, the Committee decided that this forward guidance should be conditional on inflation expectations, as well as on the inflation projections of its baseline scenario, for the relevant monetary policy horizon, which currently includes 2021 and, to a lesser extent, 2022. This information on inflation would be considered altogether and, when they were sufficiently close to the inflation target for the corresponding horizon, they would indicate the end of the intention. 
19. Given the difficulties inherent in using forward guidance in emerging economies, in addition to expectations and projections of inflation in the relevant horizon, the Committee also deemed necessary to condition its interest rate policy intention on two other factors. First, it is conditional on the maintenance of the fiscal regime, since its rupture would imply significant changes to the structural interest rate of the economy. Second, it is conditional on the anchoring of long-term inflation expectations, given that an unanchoring would indicate that the costs derived from the monetary stimulus would be outweighing its benefits. 
20. Taking into account the baseline scenario, the balance of risks, and the broad array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to lower the Selic rate by 0.25 percentage point to 2.00% p.a. The Committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective inflation, a higher-than-usual variance in the balance of risks, and it is consistent with the convergence of inflation to its target over the relevant horizon for monetary policy, which includes 2021 and, to a lesser extent, 2022. 
21. The Committee believes that persevering in the process of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy is essential for a sustainable economic recovery. The Copom also stresses that doubts regarding the continuation of the reform agenda and permanent changes to the fiscal consolidation process could result in an increase in the structural interest rate. 
22. The Copom believes that the current economic conditions continue to recommend an unusually strong monetary stimulus but it recognizes that, due to prudential and financial stability reasons, the remaining space for monetary policy stimulus, if it exists, should be small. Consequently, possible future adjustments to the current degree of monetary stimulus would occur with additional gradualism and would depend on the perception of the fiscal trajectory, as well as on new information that changes the Committee's current assessment about prospective inflation. 
23. Despite the asymmetry on its balance of risks, the Copom does not foresee reductions in the monetary stimulus unless inflation expectations, as well as its baseline scenario inflation projections, are sufficiently close to the inflation target at the relevant horizon for monetary policy, which currently includes 2021 and, to a lesser extent, 2022. This intention is conditional on the maintenance of the current fiscal regime and on the anchoring of long-term inflation expectations.

21/06/2022;247;Roberto Campos Neto;"1. The global environment has deteriorated further, marked by downward revisions on prospective global growth in an environment of strong and persistent inflationary pressures arising from the global recovery after the pandemic period. These pressures have intensified due to the increase of commodity prices in 2022 and, more recently, by the Covid-19 wave in China, further prolonging the process of normalization in the supply of industrial inputs. The reorganization of global production chains, already fueled by the war in Ukraine, is expected to intensify with the search for a greater regional arrangement of the supply of inputs. In Copom?s view, these developments might have long-term consequences and lead to more persistent inflationary pressures on global production of goods.
2. The growth of major economies has been revised down for 2022 and 2023 due to the expected reversal of the stimuli implemented during the long pandemic period, in particular by monetary policy action. Negative growth revisions were also noted for China, partially reflecting the zero-Covid policy adopted by that country.
3. Central banks in developed and emerging countries have adopted a more contractionary stance against increased inflation, although, in some of these economies, current interest rates are still at levels evaluated as expansionary. The repricing of monetary policy in advanced economies, the increase in risk aversion, and the change in the growth outlook have affected financial conditions in both advanced and emerging economies. The Committee has also discussed the growing risks involving a global deceleration in a highly pressured inflationary environment.
4. Turning to the Brazilian economy, the set of indicators released since the previous meeting suggests a growth rate above the Committee?s expectations. Indicators related to the labor market continue to recover and the release of the 2022Q1 GDP pointed to a higher-than-expected pace of activity, raising the statistical carry-over for this year. Household consumption continues to contribute positively, while, in 2022Q1, Gross Fixed Capital Formation contributed negatively.
5. Consumer inflation remains high, with increases spread among several components, and continues to be more persistent than anticipated. The inflation of services and of industrial goods remain high, and the recent shocks continue to cause a strong increase in food and fuel-related components. Recent readings were higher than expected and the surprise came in both the more volatile components and on items associated with core inflation. The inflation of the components most sensitive to the economic cycle and the monetary policy continues elevated, and the various measures of underlying inflation accelerated, standing above the range compatible with meeting the inflation target. Inflation expectations for 2022, 2023, and 2024 collected by the Focus survey are around 8.5%, 4.7%, and 3.25%, respectively.
6. In the reference scenario, the interest rate path is extracted from the Focus survey, and the exchange rate starts at USD/BRL 4.902 and evolves according to the purchasing power parity (PPP). This scenario assumes a path for the Selic rate that ends 2022 at 13.25% p.a., falls to 10.0% in 2023 and 7.50% in 2024. The Committee decided to keep the assumption that oil prices follow approximately the futures market curve for the following six months, ending the year at USD 110/barrel, and then start increasing 2% per year in January 2023. Moreover, the energy flag is assumed to be ?yellow? in  December 2022, 2023, and 2024. In this scenario, Copom?s inflation projections stand at 8.8% for 2022, 4.0% for 2023, and 2.7% for 2024. Inflation projections for administered prices are 7.0% for 2022, 6.3% for 2023, and 3.3% for 2024. The projections based on the reference scenario do not incorporate the tax measures on fuels, energy, and telecom prices under the approval process. The Committee judges that the uncertainty in its assumptions and projections is higher than usual and has increased since the previous meeting.
7. The Committee assesses that the global inflationary scenario continues to be marked by inflationary pressures stemming from both persistently high demand for goods and supply shocks linked to the war in Ukraine and China's Covid-19 policy. The Committee further believes that recent policies restricting trade in agricultural products in commodity-producing countries, coupled with the effects of the war in Ukraine, bring additional risk to global inflationary pressures. In the Copom?s view, these developments might have long-term consequences and lead to more persistent inflationary pressures.
8. The Committee then discussed the growing risks involving a sharper global deceleration in a highly pressured inflationary environment. The Committee already anticipates a slowdown in global activity in the coming quarters, due to geopolitical tensions and the monetary policy tightening, as well as financial conditions underway in several central economies. The Committee believes that the global synchrony in the process of stimulus withdrawal introduces additional risks to markets and may boost its impact on the prospective scenario.
9. In this context of global deceleration, Copom considers a possible reversion, even if partial, of the increase in international commodities measured in local currency observed in recent quarters.
10. The Committee reinforces that uncertainty about the future of the country's fiscal framework and fiscal policies that support aggregate demand may bring an upside risk to the inflationary scenario and to inflation expectations.
11. The Committee believes that recent domestic activity data, which have prompted a positive revision to 2022 growth, still reflect, for the most part, the post-pandemic normalization process of the economy, both in the higher consumption of services and in the utilization of the excess savings observed over historical records, and the transitory fiscal stimulus provided in the first half of the year. The Committee assesses that activity should decelerate in the coming quarters when the lagged impacts of monetary policy will be more strongly felt.
12. The Committee emphasizes that risks to its scenarios remain in both directions. Among the upside risks for the inflationary scenario and inflation expectations, it should be emphasized (i) a greater persistence of global inflationary pressures; and (ii) the uncertainty about the country's future fiscal framework and fiscal policies that support aggregate demand, partially incorporated in inflation expectations and asset prices. Among the downside risks, it should be noted (i) a possible reversion, even if partial, of the increase in the price of international commodities measured in local currency; and (ii) a greater deceleration of economic activity than projected. The Committee assessed that the tax measures under the approval process imply a sizable reduction in inflation in the current year, although they raise by a smaller magnitude inflation in the relevant horizon for monetary policy. The Committee assesses that the uncertain and volatile current scenario requires serenity when evaluating the risks.
13. Copom discussed the conduct of monetary policy, considering the set of projections analyzed, as well as the balance of risks for prospective inflation.
14. Copom opened the discussion by evaluating the adjustment cycle carried out up to this meeting. It was emphasized that the current monetary tightening cycle was quite intense and timely and that, due to monetary policy lags, much of the expected contractionary effect and its impact on current inflation are still to be seen.
15. Still, Copom observed deterioration in both the short-term inflationary dynamics and the longer-term projections, even though the scenario is surrounded by higher than usual uncertainty and volatility.
16. The Committee believes, based on the projections used and on its balance of risks, that the strategy required to bring the 4.0% projected inflation to around the target for the relevant horizon combines, on the one hand, a terminal interest rate above that used in the reference scenario and, on the other, the maintenance of the interest rate in significantly contractionary territory for a longer period than that used in the reference scenario. Thus, the strategy of convergence around the target requires a more contractionary interest rate than that used in the reference scenario for the entire relevant horizon.
17. Copom then debated the monetary policy options for this meeting. The Committee concluded that a further adjustment of 0.50 p.p. was appropriate in an environment of high uncertainty and the significantly contractionary stage of monetary policy, which, considering its lags, should affect the economy more strongly as of the second half of 2022.
18. The signaling for the next meeting was then discussed. Given the persistence of the recent shocks, the Committee evaluated that only the perspective of maintaining the Selic rate for a sufficiently long period would not assure, at this moment, the convergence of inflation around the target in the relevant horizon. The Committee then chose to signal a further adjustment, of equal or smaller magnitude. This strategy was deemed more appropriate to ensure the convergence of inflation over the relevant horizon, as well as the anchoring of longer-term inflation expectations, while reflecting the already implemented monetary tightening, reinforcing the cautious monetary policy stance, and emphasizing the uncertainty of the scenario.
19. Taking into account the assessed scenarios, the balance of risks, and the broad array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to increase the Selic rate by 0.50 p.p. to 13.25% p.a. The Committee judges that this decision reflects the uncertainty around its scenarios for prospective inflation, an even higher-than-usual variance in the balance of risks and is consistent with the strategy for inflation convergence to a level around its target throughout the relevant horizon for monetary policy, which includes 2023. Without compromising its fundamental objective of ensuring price stability, this decision also implies smoothing of economic fluctuations and fosters full employment.
20. The Committee considers that, given its inflation projections and the risk of a deanchoring of long-term expectations, it is appropriate to continue advancing in the process of monetary tightening significantly into even more restrictive territory. The Committee emphasizes that it will persist in its strategy until the disinflation process and the expectation anchoring around its targets consolidate.
21. For its next meeting, the Committee foresees a new adjustment, of the same or lower magnitude. The Committee stresses that the growing uncertainty of the current scenario, coupled with the advanced stage of the current monetary policy cycle, and its impacts yet to be observed, require additional caution in its actions. The Copom emphasizes that its future policy steps could be adjusted to ensure the convergence of inflation towards its targets and will depend on the evolution of economic activity, on the balance of risks, and on inflation expectations and projections for the relevant horizon for monetary policy.
"
09/08/2022;248;Roberto Campos Neto;"1.The global environment remains adverse and volatile, with marked downwardrevisions on prospective global growth in an environment of inflationary pressures.
2.The growth of major economies has been revised down for 2022 and 2023 due to the expected reversal of the stimuli implemented during the long pandemic period, inparticular, those of monetary policy. Furthermore, the war in Ukraine impacts thesupply of natural gas, thus bringing additional uncertainty to the European economic scenario, whereas, in China, the deterioration of the real estate sector, coupled with the policy to fight Covid-19, negatively impact the country?s growth prospects.
3.Inflation rates figures in some advanced economies released in the period suggestthe persistence of strong pressures, although an incipient normalization in the supplychains and accommodation in the prices of leading commodities is already observed recently. Coupled with the adjustment of inventories of industrial goods, thesedevelopments might imply the moderation of inflationary pressures related to goods.On the other hand, the degree of slack in the labor market in these economies suggests that inflationary pressures in the sector of services might take long to dissipate.
4.Central banks in developed and emerging countries have adopted a morecontractionary stance against increased inflation. The acceleration in the process ofnormalization of monetary policy in advanced economies, the increase in risk aversion, and the change in the growth outlook have impacted financial conditions in bothadvanced and emerging economies, affecting the volatility of assets and economicgrowth prospects. The Committee continues monitoring the risks involving a globaldeceleration in a highly pressured inflationary environment.
5.Turning to the Brazilian economy, the set of indicators released since the previous Copom meeting continues to suggest that the economy grew throughout the second quarter, with the labor market recovery stronger than expected by the Committee.Indicators related to both formal job openings and employment and unemploymentrates suggest a rapid normalization in the labor-intensive sectors after the pandemic.
6.Consumer inflation remains high, with increases spread among several components, and continues to be more persistent than anticipated. The reduction of taxes on energy prices is already observed in high frequency indicators, although the components more sensitive to the economic cycle and monetary policy, with higher inflationary inertia,continue above the range compatible with meeting the inflation target. Inflationexpectations for 2022, 2023, and 2024 collected by the Focus survey are around 7.2%, 5.3%, and 3.3%, respectively.
7.In the reference scenario, the interest rate path is extracted from the Focus survey,and the exchange rate starts at USD/BRL 5.302 and evolves according to the purchasing power parity (PPP). This scenario assumes a path for the Selic rate that ends 2022 at13.75% p.a., falls to 11.00% in 2023 and to 8.00% in 2024. The Committee assumes that oil prices follow approximately the futures market curve for the following six months and then start increasing 2% per year onwards. Moreover, the energy flag is assumed to be ""yellow"" in December 2022, 2023, and 2024. In this scenario, Copom's inflationprojections stand at 6.8% for 2022, 4.6% for 2023, and 2.7% for 2024. Inflationprojections for administered prices are -1.3% for 2022, 8.4% for 2023, and 3.6% for 2024. The projections based on the reference scenario incorporate the tax measures recently approved. For the six-quarter-ahead horizon, which mitigates the calendar-year impact but incorporates the second-round effects of the tax measures that occur in 2022 and the first quarter of 2023, the 12-month inflation projection stands at 3.5%. The Committee judges that the uncertainty in its assumptions and projections is higher than usual.
8. The Committee evaluates that the global inflationary scenario is still challenging. Pressures stemming from both persistently high demand for goods, as well as supply shocks linked to the war in Ukraine, China's Covid-19 policy, and policies restricting trade in agricultural products in commodity-producing countries, might have long-term consequences and lead to more persistent inflationary pressures. However, the re-evaluation of future global demand has led to price declines of leading commodities as well as the prospects of reduced imbalance in the industrial goods market. Copom, even so, reiterates that some geopolitical and particular issues in these markets still deserve attention.
9. The Committee discussed the impacts of the global synchrony in the process of stimulus withdrawal. Copom noticed a more accelerated pace in the process of monetary policy adjustment in advanced economies, as well as the commitment stated in the communication of major central banks to reduce inflationary pressures. It was observed that this movement elevated the market volatility, unevenly impacting several assets and increasing risk aversion. In addition, given the persistence of the inflationary process in advanced economies and the consequent responses by several central banks, the Committee evaluates that the probability of alternative scenarios incorporating a sharper deceleration of global economic activity increased. The uncertainty about the energy scenario in Europe, the dynamics of sectors more sensitive to interest rates in the United States, and the prospects of a more gradual growth in China contribute to this scenario.
10. In the domestic scenario, Copom evaluates that temporary policies aimed to support income could provide stimulus to aggregate demand and the extension of these policies might increase the country?s risk premia and inflation expectations as they pressure aggregate demand and worsen the fiscal trajectory. The Committee reiterates that there are several channels by which fiscal policy may affect inflation, including its effect on activity, asset prices, and inflation expectations.
11. Labor market data, especially concerning the pace of job openings and the unemployment rate, surprised in the period and indicate a faster-than-anticipated narrowing of the estimate of the output gap. However, the Committee evaluates that economic slackness persists. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that evaluations about the output gap, especially about the component related to the labor market, are always subject to uncertainty, notably in the current situation in which the economy is still normalizing after the pandemic and with remarkable heterogeneity across sectors in this process. Copom will continue monitoring and evaluating the output gap in the next releases. The Committee still considers that activity should decelerate in the coming quarters when the lagged impacts of monetary policy will be more strongly felt.
12. It emphasizes that risks to its scenarios remain in both directions. Among the upside risks for the inflationary scenario and inflation expectations, it should be emphasized (i) a greater persistence of global inflationary pressures; and (ii) an increase in the risk premium due to the uncertainty about the country's future fiscal framework and additional fiscal stimuli that support aggregate demand, partially incorporated in inflation expectations and asset prices. Among the downside risks, it should be noted (i) a possible reversion, even if partial, of the increase in the price of international commodities measured in local currency; and (ii) a greater deceleration of economic activity than projected. The Committee assesses that the possibility that fiscal policies that support aggregate demand become permanent heightens the upside risks of the inflationary scenario. On the other hand, the Committee notes that the rising risk of a greater global deceleration increases the downside risks to inflation. The Committee assesses that the still uncertain and volatile current scenario requires serenity when evaluating the prospective risks.
13. Copom discussed the conduct of monetary policy, considering the set of projections evaluated, as well as the balance of risks for inflation.
14. Following its usual governance, the relevant horizon for monetary policy now refers to the year 2023, and, to a lesser extent, 2024. However, at this meeting, the Committee noted that inflation projections for the years of 2022 and 2023 were heavily impacted by temporary tax measures across calendar years. Therefore, the Committee decided to emphasize the projections for 12-month inflation in the first quarter of 2024, which reflects the relevant horizon, smoothens out the primary effects from tax changes, but incorporates their second-round effects on the relevant inflation projections for monetary policy decisions.
15. The 12-month inflation projection for the first quarter of 2024 ? which incorporates the secondary effects of the tax changes as well as the cumulative effects of keeping interest rates at a significantly contractionary level ? is consistent with the strategy of inflation convergence to around the target over the relevant horizon. The Committee noted that inflation projection for 2024 is also around the target.
16. Copom opened the discussion by evaluating the adjustment cycle carried out up to this meeting. It was emphasized that the current monetary tightening cycle was quite intense and timely and that, due to the long and variable monetary policy lags, much of the expected contractionary effect and its impact on current inflation are still to be seen. These impacts should become clearer in the activity indicators for the second half of the year, but the Committee anticipates that measures to sustain aggregate demand, which will be implemented in the short term, may make it difficult a more precise evaluation about the stage of the economic cycle and the impacts of monetary policy.
17. The Committee noted that the short-term inflationary dynamics remains challenging, with increasing core inflation measures in an environment of surprises in current activity, and that its projections continued to deteriorate, even though the scenario is surrounded by uncertainty and volatility above the usual. It was emphasized that the rise in expectations and medium-term projections was concentrated in the inflation of administered prices, due to the temporary nature of some tax measures.
18. The Committee assessed, based on the projections used and on its balance of risks, that the strategy required to bring the projected inflation to around the target for the relevant horizon required that the monetary tightening cycle continued to move significantly further into contractionary territory, with an additional adjustment at this meeting and the maintenance of the interest rate in significantly contractionary territory for a sufficiently extended period.
19. Copom then debated the monetary policy options for this meeting. The Committee concluded that a further adjustment of 0.50 p.p. was appropriate in an environment of high uncertainty, despite the already significantly contractionary stage of monetary policy, which, considering its lags, should affect the economy more strongly as of the second half of 2022.
20. The Committee decided to signal that it will assess the need for a smaller residual adjustment at the next meeting, with the aim of bringing inflation to around the target in the relevant horizon. Moreover, given the persistence of recent shocks, the Committee will remain vigilant and will assess whether the prospect of maintaining the Selic rate by itself for a sufficiently long period will ensure such a convergence. This strategy was deemed more appropriate to ensure the convergence of inflation over the relevant horizon, as well as the anchoring of longer-term inflation expectations, while reflecting the already implemented monetary tightening, reinforcing the cautious monetary policy stance, and emphasizing the uncertainty of the scenario.
21.Taking into account the assessed scenarios, the balance of risks, and the broad array of available information, Copom unanimously decided to increase the Selic rate by 0.50 p.p. to 13.75% p.a. The Committee judges that this decision reflects the uncertaintyaround its scenarios for prospective inflation, an even higher-than-usual variance in the balance of risks and is consistent with the strategy for inflation convergence to a level around its target throughout the relevant horizon for monetary policy, which includes 2023 and, to a lesser extent, 2024. Without compromising its fundamental objective of ensuring price stability, this decision also implies smoothing of economic fluctuationsand fosters full employment.
22.The Committee considers that, given its inflation projections and the risk of adeanchoring of long-term expectations, it is appropriate to continue advancing in theprocess of monetary tightening significantly into even more restrictive territory. TheCommittee emphasizes that it will persist in its strategy until the disinflation processand the expectation anchoring around its targets consolidate.
23.The Committee will evaluate the need for a residual adjustment, of lowermagnitude, in its next meeting. The Copom emphasizes that it will remain vigilant and that future policy steps could be adjusted to ensure the convergence of inflationtowards its targets. It also stresses that the uncertainty of the current scenario, bothdomestic and foreign ones, coupled with the advanced stage of the current monetary policy cycle, and its cumulative impacts yet to be observed, require additional cautionin its actions.
"
27/09/2022;249;Roberto Campos Neto;"1.The global environment remains adverse and volatile, with continued downward revisions on prospective growth in the major economies, especially in China. The data released since the previous Copom meeting reinforce the view that the U.S. labor market, as well as in other advanced economies, remains heated. However, the reversal of countercyclical policies in major economies, the persistence of the war in Ukraine with its consequences on natural gas supplies to Europe, and the continuation of the Covid-19 policy in China reinforce a prospect of a slowdown in global growth in the coming quarters.
2.The inflationary environment remains challenging. There is an incipient normalization in supply chains and an accommodation in the prices of major commodities in the recent period, which should lead to a moderation in global goods-related inflationary pressures. On the other hand, the low degree of slack in the labor market in these economies suggests that inflationary pressures in the sector of services might take long to dissipate.
3.The process of normalization of monetary policy in advanced economies continues towards contractionary rates in a synchronized way across countries, impacting economic growth expectations, and raising the risk of abrupt repricing movements in the markets. The Committee continues to monitor the risks related to the global slowdown and the increase in risk aversion in a highly pressured inflationary environment.
4.As for the domestic outlook, second quarter GDP came stronger than expected.Robust growth was observed in both consumption and investment. Moreover, the set of indicators released since the previous Copom meeting still suggests that the economy kept growing at the margin, albeit more moderately. Besides, the labor market continued to expand, although not completely reverting the real income decline observed in recent quarters.
5.Despite the recent reduction in prices of more volatile items and the impacts of taxmeasures, consumer inflation remains high. The recent releases have been strongly influenced by the reduction in administered prices, due to both the decrease in taxes and, to a lesser extent, the drop in international fuel prices. In addition, items related to industrial goods, reflecting the decrease in producer prices and the reduction of pressures in global value chains, also showed an incipient decline. However, the inflation of the components more sensitive to the economic cycle and the monetary policy, which present greater inflationary inertia, remain above the range compatible with meeting the inflation target. Inflation expectations for 2022, 2023, and 2024 collected by the Focus survey are around 6.0%, 5.0%, and 3.5%, respectively.
6.In the reference scenario, the interest rate path is extracted from the Focus survey,and the exchange rate starts at USD/BRL 5.202 and evolves according to the purchasing power parity (PPP). The Committee assumes that oil prices follow approximately the futures market curve for the following six months and then start increasing 2% per year onwards. Moreover, the energy flag is assumed to be ?green? in December 2022, and ?yellow? in December 2023 and 2024. In this scenario, Copom?s inflation projections stand at 5.8% for 2022, 4.6% for 2023, and 2.8% for 2024. Inflation projections for administered prices are -4.0% for 2022, 9.3% for 2023, and 3.7% for 2024. The Committee decided again to emphasize the six-quarter-ahead horizon, which reflects the relevant horizon, mitigates the primary effects from the tax changes but incorporates their second-round effects. On this horizon, which refers to the first quarter of 2024, the twelve-month inflation projection stands at 3.5%. The Committee judges that the uncertainty in its assumptions and projections is higher than usual.
7.Given the persistence of the inflationary process and the rise in inflation projections in several economies, the Committee assesses that the risk of a sharper deceleration in global economic activity has increased. This perception is reinforced by the monetary policy responses required to ensure the reanchoring of inflation, as well as the determination present in the communication from major central banks to reduce inflationary pressures.
8.The Committee assesses that a more tightening global monetary policy stance would have a disinflationary impact in Brazil in the medium term, as it leads to a widening of the global gap and less pressure on the prices of commodity and goods in general. However, it points out that the possible impacts of such repricing on assets in the short term add uncertainty about the effect on Brazilian inflation.
9.Measures of the degree of slack in the economy have great uncertainty. Currently,the analysis of some activity indicators, especially in the labor market, has led to the discussion if the output gap is narrower than that currently used by Copom in its reference scenario. In an alternative exercise assuming that the output gap would be at zero in the third quarter of 2022, inflation projections would be 4.9% and 3.0% for 2023 and 2024, respectively.
10.The Committee discussed the transmission channels and the effect of monetarypolicy on activity. Copom assessed that the pass-through of the Selic rate to the final rates of different types of credit has occurred as expected, although new corporate credit remain more robust than expected. The Committee continues to evaluate that a large part of the impact of monetary policy is still to be observed, both in economic activity and inflation, and that there was no substantial change in the transmission channels of monetary policy.
11.The Committee discussed the pace of disinflation of services and how inflation ofless volatile items would behave in the coming quarters. It evaluated that there are several factors that may affect the path of services inflation, among them the drop in current inflation itself, which reduces the inertial effect on these items, and the more positive projections for economic activity, which raises the risk of more persistent pressures in this segment. In this regard, the Committee believes that continued monitoring of these factors is necessary to assess whether the maintenance of interest rate rates for a sufficiently long period will be enough to ensure inflation convergence.
12.In the domestic scenario, Copom believes that the permanent increase in spending and the uncertainty about its trajectory from next year on may increase the country's risk premia and inflation expectations as they put pressure on aggregate demand and worsen the fiscal path expectations. The Committee reiterates that there are several channels by which fiscal policy may affect inflation, including its effect on activity, asset prices, degree of uncertainty in the economy, and inflation expectations.
13.The Committee discussed the movements in inflation expectations in the Focussurvey since the August Copom meeting. There has been a drop for 2023, but much of the movement observed is in items related to administered prices, possibly due to uncertainty about the tax recomposition of federal taxes. However, the median of inflation expectations for 2024 rose since the previous Copom meeting, even though the average has been more stable. Some members of the Committee emphasized that there was an increase in longer-term expectations in much of the emerging countries, reflecting the magnitude and persistence of the global shocks still underway. Finally, all members agree that it is the monetary authority's primary and fundamental role to conduct a monetary policy consistent with the anchoring of longer-term expectations, continuously strengthening its credibility, and reducing the future disinflationary cost.
14.The Committee emphasizes that risks to its scenarios remain in both directions.Among the upside risks for the inflationary scenario and inflation expectations, it should be emphasized (i) a greater persistence of global inflationary pressures; (ii) the uncertainty about the country's future fiscal framework and additional fiscal stimuli that support aggregate demand, partially incorporated in inflation expectations and asset prices; and (iii) an output gap tighter than the currently adopted by the Committee in its reference scenario, especially in the labor market. Among the downside risks, it should be noted (i) an additional reduction in the prices of international commodities measured in local currency; (ii) a greater than projected deceleration of global economic activity; and (iii) the continuity of tax cuts assumed to be reversed in 2023. The Committee assesses that the still uncertain and volatile current scenario requires serenity when evaluating risks.
15.Copom discussed the conduct of monetary policy, considering the set of projections evaluated, as well as the balance of risks for prospective inflation.
16.The twelve-month inflation projection for the first quarter of 2024, in the scenariousing the interest rate trajectory extracted from the Focus survey, remains consistent with the strategy of inflation convergence to around the target over the relevant horizon. Moreover, the Committee continues to consider that inflation projection for 2024 is also around the target. This assessment reflects the lower-than-normal visibility of the prospective scenario, which increases the uncertainty of the specific projections communicated by the Committee over longer horizons.
17.The Committee decided again to emphasize the six-quarter-ahead horizon for itsprojections, and stresses that this decision is conditional on the temporary nature of the taxes. Copom anticipates that, if the alternative scenario of maintaining tax exemption on fuels in 2023 materialize, it will again emphasize horizons that include the first quarter of 2023. However, it assesses that there will be no relevant impacts on the conduct of monetary policy since the primary effects of such measures are already being disregarded.
18.Copom opened the discussion by evaluating the adjustment cycle carried out up tothis meeting. It was emphasized that the current monetary tightening cycle has been quite intense and timely and that, due to the long and variable monetary policy lags, much of the expected contractionary effect and its impact on current inflation are still to be seen. These impacts should become clearer in the activity indicators throughout the second half of the year, but the Committee anticipates that measures to sustain aggregate demand hinder a more precise evaluation about the stage of the economic cycle and the impacts of monetary policy.
19.Copom then debated the monetary policy options for this meeting. The options toraise the base interest rates by 0.25 p.p. and to maintain it were widely debated. On the one hand, the additional interest rate increase would reinforce the vigilance stance and reflect the observation of a stronger than expected activity. On the other hand, caution and the need to evaluate, over time, the cumulative effects to be observed of the intense and timely monetary policy cycle already undertaken would be in favor of the maintenance. Therefore, most of the Committee members assessed that, given the data released, projections, inflation expectations, the balance of risks, and the lags of the effects of the monetary policy already in significantly contractionary territory, it was appropriate to maintain the interest rate at the level of 13.75% p.a. The Committee reinforced that it is necessary to remain vigilant, assessing if the strategy of maintaining the Selic rate for a sufficiently long period will be enough to ensure the convergence of inflation.
20.Two Committee members voted for a residual adjustment of 0.25 p.p on the Selic rate. These members argued that the additional increase would strengthen the Committee?s message of commitment to its strategy, given the rise in inflation expectations and the projection in the reference scenario for 2024, in an environment of uncertainty about the level of the output gap and the dynamics of activity. These members consider that the upside risks listed in the balance of risks may have longer-lasting impacts if they materialize, suggesting additional caution in assessing the reference scenario projections for the year 2024.
21. The Committee unanimously emphasizes that it will persist until the disinflationary process consolidates and inflation expectations anchor around its targets. The Committee emphasizes that it will not hesitate to resume the tightening cycle if the disinflationary process does not proceed as expected.
22. Considering the assessed scenarios, the balance of risks, and the broad array of available information, the Copom decided to maintain the Selic rate at 13.75% p.a. The Committee judges that this decision reflects the uncertainty around its scenarios for prospective inflation, an even higher-than-usual variance in the balance of risks and is consistent with the strategy for inflation convergence to a level around its target throughout the relevant horizon for monetary policy, which includes 2023 and, to a lesser extent, 2024. Without compromising its fundamental objective of ensuring price stability, this decision also implies smoothing of economic fluctuations and fosters full employment.
23. The Committee will remain vigilant, assessing if the strategy of maintaining the Selic rate for a sufficiently long period will be enough to ensure the convergence of inflation. The Committee emphasizes that it will persist until the disinflationary process consolidates and inflation expectations anchor around its targets. The Committee reinforces that future monetary policy steps can be adjusted and will not hesitate to resume the tightening cycle if the disinflationary process does not proceed as expected."
01/11/2022;250;Roberto Campos Neto;"1.The global environment remains adverse and volatile, with downward revisions onprospective global growth. The tightening of the financial conditions in major economies, the persistence of the war in Ukraine with its consequences on energy supply to Europe, and the continuation of the Covid-19 policy in China reinforce a prospect of a slowdown in global growth in the coming quarters.
2.The inflationary environment remains challenging. There is an incipient normalization in supply chains and an accommodation in the prices of major commodities in the recent period, which should lead to a moderation in global goods-related inflationary pressures. In turn, the low level of labor market slack in some economies, coupled with high current inflation and a high degree of diffusion, suggests that inflationary pressures on the services sector may last longer.
3.The process of normalization of monetary policy in advanced economies continues towards contractionary rates synchronized across countries, tightening financial conditions, impacting economic growth expectations, and raising the risk of abrupt repricing movements in the markets. The Committee noted a stronger market sensitivity to fiscal fundamentals, including in advanced economies. This greater sensitivity, concomitant with tightening financial conditions, requires more attention from developing economies. The Committee continues to monitor the risks related to the global slowdown and the increase in risk aversion in a highly pressured inflationary environment.
4.Turning to the Brazilian economy, the set of indicators released since the previous Copom meeting continues to signal growth, albeit at a more moderate rate. The labor market continues to recover, but at a slower pace than in previous months.
5.Despite the recent reduction, driven by items which are more volatile and affected by tax measures, consumer inflation remains high. The recent releases have been strongly influenced by the reduction in administered prices, due to both the decrease in taxes and, to a lesser extent, the drop in international fuel prices. In addition, items related to industrial goods, reflecting the more intense decrease in producer prices and the reduction of pressures in global value chains, also showed deceleration. However, the inflation of the components more sensitive to the economic cycle and the monetary policy, which present greater inflationary inertia, remain above the range compatible with meeting the inflation target. Inflation expectations for 2022, 2023, and 2024 collected by the Focus survey are around 5.6%, 4.9%, and 3.5%, respectively.
6.In the reference scenario, the interest rate path is extracted from the Focus survey,and the exchange rate starts at USD/BRL 5.252 and evolves according to the purchasing power parity (PPP). The Committee assumes that oil prices follow approximately the futures market curve for the following six months and then start increasing 2% per year onwards. Moreover, the energy flag is assumed to be ?green? in December 2022, and ?yellow? in December 2023 and 2024. In this scenario, Copom?s inflation projections stand at 5.8% for 2022, 4.8% for 2023, and 2.9% for 2024. Inflation projections for administered prices are -3.9% for 2022, 9.4% for 2023, and 3.8% for 2024. The Committee decided again to emphasize the six-quarter-ahead horizon, which reflects the relevant horizon, mitigates the primary effects from the tax changes but incorporates their second-round effects. On this horizon, which refers to the second quarter of 2024, the 12-month inflation projection stands at 3.2%. The Committee judges that the uncertainty in its assumptions and projections is higher than usual.
7.The Committee still considers that the commitment and determination of centralbanks to reduce inflationary pressures and anchor expectations raise the risk of a more pronounced global slowdown. There has been an adjustment in the extent and speed of the monetary policy tightening cycle in some advanced countries, which has led to a further tightening of financial conditions.
8.The Committee noted a stronger market sensitivity to developments affecting the fiscal fundamentals, including in advanced economies. The combination of higher interest rates and sovereign debts at historically high levels, raises questions about the sustainability of public debt in several countries. Besides, the lower liquidity of the sovereign securities markets increases risk perception and demand monitoring.
9.Data on economic activity, which contribute to the assessment of the degree of slack, point to a more moderate pace of growth recently. On the one hand, the momentum of the reopening of the economy in the services sector and the fiscal stimuli are still driving consumption growth, although these impulses should slow down. On the other hand, the impact of monetary policy and its lags point to a reduction in the pace of economic activity, which tends to worsen in the coming quarters.
10.The Committee discussed the already noticeable impacts of monetary policy oncredit and economic activity data. One can notice an impact in recent data regarding both the composition of new household credit operations and the moderate increase in the delinquency rate, partly related to the behavior of the real disposable income, which suggests some reduction. The Committee observed that an additional challenge for the proper assessment of the dynamics of activity at the margin is in the seasonal adjustment of the series, especially of the indicators with a shorter sample period, due to the pandemic period. Exercises show a high sensitivity of the signal and the magnitude of the seasonally adjusted results to small changes in the samples and methods used.
11.In the domestic scenario, Copom believes that the permanent increase in spending and the uncertainty about its trajectory from next year on may increase the country's risk premia and inflation expectations as they put pressure on aggregate demand and worsen the fiscal path expectations. The Committee reiterates that there are several channels by which fiscal policy may affect inflation, including its effect on activity, asset prices, degree of uncertainty in the economy, and inflation expectations.
12.The Committee emphasizes that risks to its scenarios remain in both directions.Among the upside risks for the inflationary scenario and inflation expectations, it should be emphasized (i) a greater persistence of global inflationary pressures; (ii) the uncertainty about the country's future fiscal framework and additional fiscal stimuli that support aggregate demand, partially incorporated in inflation expectations and asset prices; and (iii) an output gap tighter than the currently adopted by the Committee in its reference scenario, especially in the labor market. Among the downside risks, it should be noted (i) an additional reduction in the prices of international commodities measured in local currency; (ii) a greater than projected deceleration of global economic activity; and (iii) the continuity of tax cuts assumed to be reversed in 2023. The Committee assesses that the still uncertain and volatile current scenario requires serenity when evaluating risks.
13.Copom discussed the conduct of monetary policy, considering the set of projections evaluated, as well as the balance of risks for inflation.
14.The 12-month inflation projection for the second quarter of 2024, in the scenariousing the interest rate trajectory extracted from the Focus survey, remains consistent with the strategy of inflation convergence to around the target over the relevant horizon. The Committee decided again to emphasize the six-quarter-ahead horizon for its projections, and stresses that this decision is conditional on the temporary nature of the taxes. Moreover, the Committee continues to consider that inflation projection for 2024 is also around the target. This assessment reflects the lower-than-normal visibility of the forward-looking scenario, which increases the uncertainty of the point projections communicated by the Committee over longer horizons.
15.Copom anticipates that, if the alternative scenario of maintaining tax exemption on fuels in 2023 materializes, it will again emphasize usual horizons that include the first quarter of 2023. However, it assesses that there will be no relevant impacts on the conduct of monetary policy since the primary effects of such measures are already being disregarded.
16.Copom began by discussing the evolution of the broad array of data monitored, the projections, inflation expectations, and the balance of risks. Inflation projections showed a slight increase at longer horizons, reflecting upward revisions for inflation of market prices in the short term and a small increase in the projection for administered prices. The Committee assesses that the projections remain at values consistent with the strategy of reaching a level around the target over the relevant horizon. Inflation expectations from the Focus survey showed a more pronounced drop at shorter horizons but remains relatively stable for longer ones. Risks remain high, requiring continuous monitoring and serenity in their assessment. Regarding the degree of slack in the domestic economy, the Committee continues to monitor different metrics and strategies for the assessment of the output gap, as well as for current and prospective activity, and considers that there has been some decrease in the estimated slack since its latest update. Copom reinforces that its projection incorporates an increase in slack throughout the monetary policy horizon, as a result of the monetary adjustment undertaken in recent quarters. Finally, the Committee is following with special attention the evolution of services inflation, which depends on both inflationary inertia and the output gap, and whose trajectory will become clearer over time.
17.Copom chose to maintain the interest rate, reinforcing the need to evaluate, overtime, the accumulated impacts to be observed of the intense and timely monetary policy cycle already undertaken. Therefore, the Committee members assessed that, given the data released, projections, inflation expectations, the balance of risks, and the lags of the effects of the monetary policy already in significantly contractionary territory, it was appropriate to maintain the interest rate at 13.75% p.a. The Committee reinforced that it is necessary to remain vigilant, assessing if the strategy of maintaining the Selic rate for a sufficiently long period will be enough to ensure the convergence of inflation.
18.The Committee emphasizes that it will persist until the disinflationary processconsolidates and inflation expectations anchor around its targets. The Committee emphasizes that it will not hesitate to resume the tightening cycle if the disinflationary process does not proceed as expected.

13/12/2022;251;Roberto Campos Neto;"1. The global environment remains adverse and volatile, marked by prospects of below-potential 2023 global growth. The tightening of financial conditions in major economies, difficulties in energy supply to Europe, and a challenging scenario for growth in China, partly due to the Covid-19 policy in the country, reinforce a slowing global growth outlook in the coming quarters.
2. The inflationary environment remains challenging. There is a normalization in supply chains and an accommodation in the prices of major commodities in the recent period, which should lead to a moderation in global goods-related inflationary pressures. In turn, the low level of labor market slack in some economies, coupled with high current inflation and a high degree of diffusion, suggests that inflationary pressures on the services sector should last longer.
3. The process of normalization of monetary policy in advanced economies continues towards contractionary rates synchronized across countries, tightening financial conditions, impacting economic growth expectations, and raising the risk of abrupt repricing movements in the markets. The Committee noted a stronger market sensitivity of financial assets to fiscal fundamentals, including in advanced economies, and lower liquidity in several markets. This environment calls for greater caution in the conduct of economic policies also by emerging economies.
4. Turning to the Brazilian economy, the set of indicators released since the previous meeting corroborates the scenario of slowdown in the growth expected by the Committee. The release of the third quarter GDP figures suggested a more moderate growth rate than in previous quarters, despite expansion in all components of demand. Similarly, the labor market continues to recover, but at a slower pace than in previous months.
5. Despite the recent reduction, especially on items which are more volatile and affected by tax measures, consumer inflation remains high. Items related to industrial goods, reflecting the more intense decrease in producer prices and the reduction of pressures in global value chains, also showed deceleration, albeit still slow. The inflation of the components more sensitive to the economic cycle and the monetary policy, which present greater inflationary inertia, remain above the range compatible with meeting the inflation target, albeit showing some marginal moderation. Inflation expectations for 2022, 2023, and 2024 collected by the Focus survey are around 5.9%, 5.1%, and 3.5%, respectively.
6. In the reference scenario, the interest rate path is extracted from the Focus survey, and the exchange rate starts at USD/BRL 5.252 and evolves according to the purchasing power parity (PPP). The Committee assumes that oil prices follow approximately the futures market curve for the following six months and then start increasing 2% per year onwards. Moreover, the energy flag is assumed to be ?green? in December 2022 and ?yellow? in December 2023 and 2024. In this scenario, Copom?s inflation projections stand at 6.0% for 2022, 5.0% for 2023, and 3.0% for 2024. Inflation projections for administered prices are -3.6% for 2022, 9.1% for 2023, and 4.2% for 2024. The Committee decided again to emphasize the six-quarter-ahead horizon, which reflects the relevant horizon, mitigates the primary effects from the tax changes but incorporates their second-round effects. On this horizon, which refers to the second quarter of 2024, the 12-month inflation projection stands at 3.3%. The Committeejudges that the uncertainty in its assumptions and projections is higher than usual.
7. The Committee discussed the speed of the global disinflation process. On the one hand, the relaxation of pressures on global production chains, as well as the recent drop in commodity prices, indicate that the movement should continue in the short term, especially in the industrial goods, energy, and food segments. On the other hand, the Committee discussed that, given the spread of inflationary pressures to the services segment, which has a more inertial nature, in an environment of tight labor markets in several countries, the disinflation process should be non-linear and slower than that observed in recent episodes.
8. Thus, the Committee continues to assess that the commitment and determination of central banks to reduce inflationary pressures and anchor expectations consolidate a global scenario of longer tightening of financial conditions, with interest rates at the end of the tightening cycle maintained for a sufficiently long period at contractionary levels, raising the risk of a more pronounced global deceleration.
9. The Committee discussed two recent facts while analyzing the international markets. Firstly, it continues to assess that markets are more sensitive to developments that affect fiscal fundamentals, due to the combination of higher interest rates and sovereign debt at historically high levels. In addition, the Committee discussed the lower liquidity present in sovereign bond markets, possibly due to greater uncertainty in the interest rate dynamics, the reversal of long-term asset purchase policies and regulatory changes. These issues require monitoring and may also impact assets from emerging economies more strongly.
10. Data on economic activity in Brazil continues to indicate a more moderate pace of marginal growth. The release of the third quarter GDP figures indicates a reduction in the pace of growth, especially in some of the more cyclical components. Nevertheless, growth was observed in all demand components and, in the supply side, growth in industry and services. Moreover, labor market data also indicate a reduction in the pace of job openings, but still with positive marginal net hirings. The set of released data, including the drop in confidence indicators and the reduction in credit granting, together with the lagged effects of monetary policy, reinforce the Committee's expectation of a slowdown in the pace of economic activity, which should worsen over the coming quarters.
11. The inflationary outlook was then discussed, based on the more recent information. Some members noted the benign movement of commodities in BRL, highlighting additional downside risks ahead. Other members emphasized the volatile nature of these prices in an environment of pressured inventories. Finally, all members evaluated that current inflation did not surprise significantly in relation to expectations or substantially changed the understanding about future inflation dynamics. Moreover, they emphasized that disinflation in services and core inflation ? components with greater inertia ? will require increased attention and perseverance in the conduct of monetary policy.
12. The Committee discussed extensively the impacts of different fiscal scenarios on inflation. In its analysis, the Committee reiterated the different channels through which fiscal policy can affect inflation not only via the primary effects of aggregated demand but also via asset prices, the degree of economic uncertainty, inflation expectations, and neutral interest rate. The Committee evaluated that changes in parafiscal policies or the reversal of structural reforms that lead to a less efficient allocation of resources might reduce the power of monetary policy. In the different exercises analyzed, it was evaluated that the final effect, either on inflation or on activity, will depend on both the combination and the magnitude of the fiscal and parafiscal policies. Furthermore, it was highlighted that the existence of economic slack and the confidence in the debt sustainability are determining factors for an expansionary fiscal policy to achieve the aimed impacts on the economic activity. In an environment of a narrow output gap, the impact of significant fiscal stimulus on the path of inflation tends to outweigh the aimed impacts on economic activity.
13. The Committee believes that there is still a lot of uncertainty about the prospective fiscal scenario and that the moment requires caution in risk assessment. The Committee reiterates that it will continue to monitor future fiscal policy developments and their potential impacts on prospective inflation dynamics.
14. It emphasizes that risks to its scenarios remain in both directions. Among the upside risks for the inflationary scenario and inflation expectations, it should be emphasized (i) a greater persistence of global inflationary pressures; (ii) the heightened uncertainty about the country's future fiscal framework and additional fiscal stimuli that support aggregate demand, partially incorporated in inflation expectations and asset prices; and (iii) an output gap tighter than the one currently adopted by the Committee in its reference scenario, especially in the labor market. Among the downside risks, it should be noted (i) an additional reduction in the prices of international commodities measured in local currency; (ii) a greater-than-projected deceleration of global economic activity; and (iii) the continuity of tax cuts assumed to be reversed in 2023. The current scenario, particularly uncertain on the fiscal side, requires serenity when evaluating risks. The Committee will closely monitor future developments in fiscal policy and, in particular, its effects on asset prices and inflation expectations, with potential impacts on the dynamics of future inflation.
15. Copom discussed the conduct of monetary policy, considering the set of projections evaluated, as well as the balance of risks for inflation.
16. The 12-month inflation projection for the second quarter of 2024, in the scenario using the interest rate trajectory extracted from the Focus Survey, remains consistent with the strategy of inflation convergence to around the target over the relevant horizon. The Committee decided again to emphasize the six-quarter-ahead horizon for its projections, and stresses that this decision is conditional on the temporary nature of the taxes. Moreover, the Committee continues to consider that inflation projection for 2024 is also around the target. This assessment reflects the lower-than-normal visibility of the forward-looking scenario, which increases the uncertainty of the point projections communicated by the Committee over longer horizons.
17. Copom anticipates that, if the alternative scenario of maintaining tax exemption on fuels in 2023 materializes, it will again emphasize usual horizons that include the first quarter of 2023. However, it assesses that there will be no relevant impacts on the conduct of monetary policy since the primary effects of such measures are already being disregarded.
18. Copom began by discussing the evolution of the broad array of data monitored, the projections, inflation expectations, output gap, and the balance of risks. Copom's inflation projections showed a slight increase over the relevant horizon due to both an increase in the projection for the inflation of market prices in shorter terms and a revision of the projection for the inflation of administered prices over longer terms. Compared to the previous meeting, the median inflation expectations from the Focus Survey rose slightly for 2023 and remained stable for 2024. However, regarding 2024, the Committee noted with concern a rise in the average expectations. The uncertainty about future fiscal dynamics, and its consequences on inflation dynamics, was discussed, and the uncertain environment was deemed to require serenity in assessing these risks. Services inflation showed some moderation but remains at high levels, and the Committee believes that the disinflation process of this component will become clearer over time. Finally, regarding the output gap, the Committee observed a reduction in the degree of economic slack in the third quarter, due to data revisions and the release of domestic variables, but believes that the gap should widen over the relevant horizon.
19. Copom chose to maintain the interest rate, reinforcing the need to evaluate, over time, the cumulative impacts to be observed of the intense and timely monetary policy cycle already undertaken. Therefore, the Committee members assessed that, given the data released, projections, inflation expectations, the balance of risks, and the lags of the effects of the monetary policy already in significantly contractionary territory, it was appropriate to maintain the interest rate at the level of 13.75% p.a. The Committee reinforced that it is necessary to remain vigilant, assessing if the strategy of maintaining the Selic rate for a sufficiently long period will be enough to ensure the convergence of inflation.
