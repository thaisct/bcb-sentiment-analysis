
IPCA inflation totaled in April and May 0.25% and 0.28%, respectively, down from 0.37% in March. As a 
consequence, inflation through May stood at 1.79%, above the 1.75% rate reached in the same period of last year. 
Regulated prices totaled 1.35%, down from 2.70%, according to the same comparison basis, contributing to contain 
inflation, once market prices reached 2.01% in the period, above the 1.27% observed in the same period of 2006. 
Twelve-month trailing inflation through May reached 3.18% (compared to 4.23% through May 2006), while market 
 
1
 
 
 
 
 
 
prices increased 3.32% and regulated prices grew by 2.88% (2.48% and 8.24%, respectively, through May 2006). 
Month-on-month inflation deceleration in April and May was a result of market prices inflation decline (0.19% and 
0.25%, respectively, down from 0.44% in March), in contrast with regulated prices inflation acceleration (0.39% and 
0.35% in April and May, respectively, up from 0.21% in March). In addition, tradable goods price inflation 
accelerated 0.25% and 0.48%, respectively, in April and May, up from 0.21% in March, in contrast with non-
tradable price inflation, which totaled 0.13% and 0.03%, down from 0.66%, according to the same comparison 
basis. Services inflation reached 0.18% in April and 0.26% in May, totaling 4.87% in the last twelve months. 
Dampened inflationary pressures at the end of 2006 and at the start of 2007 indicate that inflation should evolve 
according to the targets path. 
  
2. 
IPCA core inflation measures did not follow the declining headline inflation behavior. Core inflation by 
exclusion of household food items and regulated prices increased month-on-month 0.29% in April and 0.33% in 
May, up from 0.23% in March. On the other hand, smoothed trimmed means core stood at 0.29%, virtually 
unchanged relative to March, while the non-smoothed trimmed means core increased 0.28% in April and 0.30% in 
May, up from 0.24% in March. In the year through May, core inflation by exclusion and smoothed and non-
smoothed trimmed means core measures recorded 1.80%, 1.51% and 1.40%, respectively, below the rates 
observed at the same period of 2006. In the last twelve months, smoothed trimmed means core totaled 3.68% in 
May and 3.86% in April, down from 3.98% in March. On the other hand, on a twelve-month trailing basis, core 
inflation by exclusion and non-smoothed trimmed means core increased in April and May, relative to March, but 
stood below the 4.5% central target for 2007. 
  
3. 
The General Price Index (IGP-DI) inflation averaged 0.29% in the first quarter of the year (0.07% in the 
same period of 2006), but decelerated in April and May, averaging 0.15%. This deceleration influenced similarly the 
behavior of two out of the three great IGP-DI components: the Consumer Price Index-Brazil (IPC-Br) reached 
0.28%, down from 0.50%, while the Wholesale Price Index (IPA-DI) declined to –0.01%, down from 0.21%. On the 
other hand, the Civil Construction National Index, which averaged 0.31% in the first quarter of the year, averaged 
0.81% in the two months ended in May, due to pressures stemming from raw material costs and wage adjustments. 
In the last twelve months through May, the IGP-DI reached 4.38%, up from –0.14% in the same period of 2006. In 
light of the 3.12% elevation of the IPC-Br in the last twelve months through May, the IGP-DI increase in the same 
period was, to a large extent, influenced by the IPA-DI and the INCC changes, which totaled 4.76% and 5.18%, 
respectively. The IPA-DI acceleration was mainly driven by agricultural prices, which increased 9.13%, while 
industrial prices only increased 3.46%. As highlighted in previous Copom Minutes, the effects of wholesale prices 
over consumer inflation will depend on prospective demand conditions and price-setters’ expectations for the future 
inflation path. 
 
4. 
Despite recording some accommodation in April, industrial output continues to present robust growth trend.  
On a three-month moving average basis, according to data seasonally adjusted by the IBGE, industrial output grew 
0.6%, compared to the previous month, maintaining the growth pace observed in March, and registered the 
thirteenth consecutive expansion. Compared to the same month of last year, industrial output grew 6%, the highest 
rate observed since June 2005 under this comparison basis, reflecting the expansion in 20 out of the 27 activities 
surveyed. In the last twelve months, industrial output expanded by 3.3%, with 3.1% for manufacturing industry and 
5.7% for mining. For May, the few leading and coincident indicators available for industrial production suggest the 
continuity of the ongoing expansion. The several incentive factors to economic activity, including the monetary 
easing already implemented, suggest that the expanding trend in industry shall continue in the upcoming months. 
 
5. 
Disaggregated industrial data showed month-on-month seasonally adjusted expansion of 15.4% in capital 
goods production and 4.2% in the production of intermediate goods. Compared to the same month last year, 
capital goods production expanded by 17.4%, while intermediate goods production increased by 5.3%. According 
to the same comparison basis, durable goods production increased by 5.4%. The dynamics of capital goods 
production reflects the consolidation of positive prospects for domestic demand growth and the influence of 
favorable international prices in some sectors. In addition, the expansion of intermediate goods production in the 
first four months of the year suggests a more generalized acceleration in industrial activity. 
 
6. 
In line with the usual seasonal pattern at the start of the year, the unemployment rate increased in the first 
months of 2007 to 10.1% in March and April up from 8.4% in December 2006. However, in the year through April, 
 
2
 
 
 
 
 
 
the average unemployment rate stood 0.2 p.p. below that observed at the same period last year. The purchasing 
power of workers increased 5% according to the same comparison basis, a record high for the series. Real payrolls 
increased 8% in the year through April, compared to the same period last year, an important factor sustaining the 
growth of aggregate demand. According to the National Industry Confederation (CNI) data seasonally adjusted by 
the BCB, manufacturing employment increased month-on-month 0.4% in April and March, after totaling 0.2% in 
February, reaching a record high for the series started in 2003. In addition, manufacturing employment expanded 
by 3.1% in April, compared to the same month of last year. Regarding formal employment, data from the Ministry of 
Labor and Employment (MTE) confirms the continuity of expansion in April, with the creation of 302 thousand new 
jobs (0.5% growth on a month-on-month seasonally adjusted basis ) and 1,361 thousand jobs in the last twelve 
months. As a consequence, in the year through April, as well as on a twelve-month trailing basis, formal job 
creation grew 4.8%, with highlights for civil construction (7.5%) and mining (4.8%). 
 
7. 
Retail sales increased 1.1% month-on-month in March, after expansions of 0.4% in February and 2% in 
January, according to data seasonally adjusted by the IBGE. With this result, retail sales expanded 2.8% in the first 
quarter, quarter-on-quarter. Compared to the same quarter of 2006, retail sales expansion reached 9.7% in the first 
quarter of the year, outpacing the 7.0% expansion recorded in the last quarter of 2006. For this robust performance 
of retail sales, which indicates strong growth of domestic demand, contributed both items more sensitive to payroll 
expansion, such as “other items of personal and domestic use” (21.8% expansion, according to this comparison 
basis) and those that are usually more sensitive to credit conditions, such as furniture and domestic appliances 
(20.5% expansion in the period). Expanded retail sales, which include the sales of civil construction material and 
vehicles, motorcycles, parts and pieces, increased 13.2% in March, compared to the same month of 2006, the 
ninth consecutive month that expanded retail sales exceeded retail sales. For the rest of the year, it is expected the 
continuity of retail sales expansion, boosted by the increase in employment and income, credit expansion, the 
monetary easing process and by the recovery of consumer confidence.   
  
8. 
Installed capacity utilization in the manufacturing industry averaged 81.0% in the year through April, up 
from 79.1% in the same period of 2006, according to CNI data without seasonal adjustment. The installed capacity 
utilization rate, according to CNI data seasonally adjusted by the BCB, stood at 81.8% in April, 3.1 p.p. above that 
observed in the same month of 2006, and 0.5 p.p. below the record high for the series observed in July 2004. 
According to CNI data seasonally adjusted by the CNI, installed capacity utilization reached 82.6% in April, a new 
record high for the series. Disaggregated indicators calculated by CNI indicated that 15 out of 19 sectors exceeded 
the average installed capacity utilization, compared to eleven sectors at the same month of last year. This 
dynamics reflects the intensification of economic activity, although recent data relative to production and absorption 
of capital goods indicate that investment expansion remains robust. In the year through April, the absorption of 
capital goods robustly increased 20.1%, compared to the same period of 2006. This result reflects the increase in 
capital goods imports (32% in volume), as well as capital goods production (15.4%). The production of inputs for 
civil construction increased 3.5%. In light of the recent installed capacity utilization rates, the continuity of 
investment expansion will be essential to avoid relevant imbalances between aggregate supply and demand. As 
stressed in previous Copom Minutes, the inflation trajectory is closely linked to current and prospective 
developments with regard to the expansion of supply of goods and services to adequately meet demand 
conditions. 
  
9. 
The trade balance continues to present robust performance, confirming the evaluations based upon 
Inflation Reports and previous Copom Minutes that depict important structural changes in the Brazilian foreign 
trade. After reaching in 2006 a US$ 46.1 billion record high, a 3.2% increase over the 2005 result, the trade 
balance continuous to register vigorous surpluses that encourage analysts to review positively their forecasts. In 
the year through May, the trade surplus reached US$16.9 billion, a 9.3% increase relative to May 2006. Exports 
rose 21.2%, to US$60.1 billion, while imports increased 26.7% to US$43.2 billion. As observed in previous Copom 
Minutes, imports have been growing more rapidly than exports at the margin, due not only to higher level of 
economic activity, but also to the strengthening of the BRL, which points to a healthy adjustment process of the 
trade balance. 
 
10. 
With regard to the international scenario, uncertainties surrounding the monetary policy stance in the US 
persist. Signals that inflation could be running above the FOMC comfort zone indicate that expectancies of an 
easing cycle starting this year may have been premature. Moreover, additional interest rate increases in the US 
 
3
 
 
 
 
 
 
cannot be discarded. Similarly, the possibility of stronger-than-expected economic deceleration and its potential 
effects over the other worldwide economies cannot be ignored. On the other hand, the strengthening of economic 
activity in Europe and the continuity of the robust expansion of the major countries in Asia have so far 
compensated for the moderate economic deceleration in the US. The maintenance of growth rates at historically 
high levels has caused higher inflationary pressures especially over raw materials and food prices. In this context of 
robust global growth, the economy and prices of Brazilian assets have shown both remarkable resilience to the 
fluctuations in international financial markets, thanks to the improvement in economic fundamentals in the recent 
years, and to a very benign behavior of export prices. In this sense, in addition to showing more resilience to 
changes in international markets sentiment, the Brazilian economy trails a growth cycle with price stability. 
Considering all this factors, the Copom continues to consider that the international scenario is favorable. 
 
11. 
Oil prices, another external source of uncertainty, rose since the last Copom meeting and still present 
volatility. The recent levels of international prices of this commodity seem to be reflecting both structural shifts in 
global demand for energy and recurrent episodes of geopolitical tensions. Despite significant risks inherent to 
forecasts on future oil prices trajectory, the main scenario considered by the Copom, which attributes no change to 
domestic gasoline prices in 2007, continues plausible. 
 
Assessment of Inflation Trends 
 
12. 
The identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available information. The 
scenario considered in the simulations utilized the following assumptions: 
  
a) Compared to the values considered in the April Copom meeting, the projection for gasoline and bottled 
gas prices adjustments in 2007 were both maintained at 0%; 
  
b) The projection for electricity and fixed telephone price adjustments in 2007 were modified relative to the 
April forecasts. The new projections for electricity and fixed telephone are –0.9% and 3.3% respectively; 
  
c) The projection for regulated prices inflation in 2007 decreased to 3.6% from 4.2% (projection of the April 
Copom meeting). These items, according to the weights released by the IBGE, represent 30.99% of the total May 
IPCA; 
  
d) The projection for regulated prices inflation in 2008 was also changed, to 4.8%. This projection is based 
on the endogenous determination model for regulated prices. This model considers the effects of seasonal 
components, exchange rate change, market prices inflation and the IGP; 
  
e) The projection for the spreads over the Selic rate, using a Vector Autoregressive model based on the 
Selic and 180-day swap rates on the eve of the meeting, estimates a 6 bps in the fourth quarter of 2007, reaching 
70 bps in the last quarter of 2008. 
 
  
13. 
Regarding fiscal policy, it is assumed that the consolidated public sector primary surplus target of 3.8% of 
GDP in 2007 and 2008 will be achieved, adjusted by the possibility of a 0.45 p.p. reduction in this percentage due 
to the implementation of PPI (Investment Pilot Program). The related assumptions considered in the previous 
meeting were maintained. 
  
14. 
Since the April Copom meeting, median IPCA inflation expectations for 2007, compiled by the BCB’s 
Investor Relations Group (Gerin), decreased to 3.5% from 3.8%. This reduction was mainly driven by a decrease of 
inflation expectations for the third quarter of 2007. The twelve-month ahead inflation expectations decreased to 
3.37% down from 3.64%. For 2008, inflation expectations remained at 4%. As mentioned in previous Minutes, 
these developments suggest the consolidation of a more favorable long-term macroeconomic scenario. 
 
15. 
Considering the hypotheses under the benchmark scenario – which assumes the maintenance of the Selic 
rate at 12.5% and the exchange rate at R$1.95//US$ during the forecast period – the projection for the 2007 IPCA 
reduced compared to the values considered at the April Copom meeting, remaining below the 4.5% target 
 
4
 
 
 
 
 
 
established by the CMN for the year. The forecast based on the market scenario – which incorporates the 
consensus exchange and Selic rates trajectories collected by Gerin on the eve of the Copom meeting – situated 
below the values considered in the April Copom meeting and below the central target for the year. The projection 
for 2008, based on the benchmark scenario, stayed relatively stable in relation to the April projection, remaining 
below the 4.5% target. Under the market scenario, the projection still remains above the 4.5% target. 
 
Monetary Policy Decision 
 
16. 
The Copom reaffirms the view expressed in previous Minutes, that in addition to containing short-term 
inflationary pressures, monetary policy has also contributed significantly for the consolidation of a favorable long-
term macroeconomic environment. Economic activity data point to strengthened demand expansion, but still do not 
suggest high probability of important pressures over inflation in the short-run. Imports expansion has contributed 
significantly to this process, complementing domestic production and, therefore, limiting potential inflationary effects 
of aggregate demand sustained growth. Moreover, despite the uncertainties regarding the continuity of the strong 
growth recently observed in the international economy, the prospects of lower liquidity in important international 
markets, and the volatility increase in the global markets, the external outlook remains favorable. Particularly 
regarding Brazilian external financing, the combination of significant trade surpluses and increasing capital inflows 
suggests that the balance of payments will continue to perform robustly. Therefore, the prospects for the inflation 
trajectory remain benign. As in recent meetings, the Copom emphasizes that the main challenge of the monetary 
policy in this context is to guarantee the consolidation of positive developments anticipated for the future.  
  
17. 
The Copom evaluates that the more benign behavior of inflation in the recent months, in contrast with 
relatively high monthly rates that had persisted since the end of 2006, confirms the convergence of inflation 
trajectory to the targets path. The emergency of global inflationary pressures still does not present risks for the 
domestic inflation trajectory in the short run, but a heated demand could increase the pass-through of wholesale 
prices pressures to consumer prices. In this sense, the Copom will continue to manage the monetary policy stance 
so that the gains obtained in inflation control in recent years become permanent. In this respect, the Copom will 
carefully monitor the evolution of inflation and the several core inflation measures in the upcoming months, 
discriminating between one-off and persistent or generalized price increases, and promptly adjusting the monetary 
policy stance to the circumstances. 
  
18. 
The preservation of inflation rates in line with the targets path and the consolidation of a long-lasting stable 
macroeconomic scenario will contribute to the progressive reduction of macroeconomic risk perception underway. 
The scope for a reduction in real interest rates in the future will naturally follow as a consequence of this improved 
perception. The Copom evaluates that its cautious monetary policy stance has been critical to increase the 
probability of inflation convergence to the targets path. For this to materialize, however, it is important that forward-
looking inflation indicators remain consistent with the recent benign inflation outlook observed in the last quarters.  
  
19. 
The Copom emphasizes, once again, that there are important time lags in the transmission of monetary 
policy stance to economic activity and inflation. Since the beginning of the monetary easing cycle, in September 
2005, the Selic rate has already been reduced by 725 b.p., with the bulk of the reduction concentrated in the last 
nine months. Consequently, the activity level has not completely mirrored the effects of the interest rates cuts, as 
well as the effects of the economic activity resumption on inflation have not completely materialized. Therefore, the 
evaluation of alternative monetary policy stances should necessarily focus on the prospective inflation scenario and 
its risks, instead of current inflation indicators.  
  
20. 
During the coming months, employment and income expansions and credit growth will continue to bolster 
economic activity. As mentioned in recent Copom Minutes, activity level should also reflect the effects of 
governmental transfers and other fiscal impulses occurred in 2006 and expected for the next quarters of the year. 
Consequently, the lagged effects of interest rates cuts on an increasingly robust aggregate demand will add up to 
other factors that will continue to contribute to this expansion. These issues become even more relevant 
considering the signs of heated aggregate demand, and the fact that the monetary policy decisions should have 
limited effects in 2007 and predominant impacts in 2008. 
  
 
5
 
 
 
 
 
 
21. 
In light of the existing incentives for expanding aggregate demand, the uncertainties surrounding the 
monetary policy transmission mechanisms, the lower distance between the current Selic rate and the medium-term 
equilibrium interest rates, and the interest rate cuts implemented since September 2005, the Copom members 
understood that the preservation of important achievements in disinflation and in preserving economic growth, with 
job creation and rising real income, demands a cautious monetary easing stance. 
  
22. 
The Copom evaluated that, since the last meeting, influences of internal and external factors on the 
balance of risks for the expected inflation trajectory exacerbated, and in opposite directions. External sector, acting 
importantly to widen aggregate supply, continues to influence inflation prospects in a predominantly benign way. 
On the other hand, expansion of domestic demand may increase the risks to inflation dynamics on the medium-run.  
  
23. 
Some participants of the Committee understood that, considering the extension of the easing process 
already implemented, the remaining uncertainties regarding the lagged impacts of the monetary easing, the 
expected behavior of the other sustaining factors of the expenditure, such as income growth, in a scenario of solid 
expansion of domestic demand for tradable and non-tradable goods and services, and of economic activity 
strengthening, the maintenance of the 25 b.p. reduction pace in the Selic target rate would contribute to extend the 
easing process over time. 
 
24. 
However, the majority of the Committee argued that the contribution of the external sector for the 
consolidation of a benign outlook for inflation could be higher than previously expected, especially by controlling the 
prices of tradable goods and by increasing investments in a heated demand environment. Such contribution is 
favoring the equilibrium between aggregate demand and domestic supply growth rates at a pace in line with 
monetary policy decisions, without compromising the convergence for the inflation targets trajectory. Therefore, five 
members of the Committee understood that the risk balance to the evolution of future inflation would justify a 50 
b.p. reduction in the Selic target rate. 
 
25. 
Given the reasons stated above, the Copom decided to continue the monetary easing cycle and reduced 
the Selic target rate to 12.00% p.a., without bias. Five votes were for the Copom monetary policy action, while two 
votes were in favor of reducing the Selic target by 25 basis points. 
 
26. 
Under an inflation-targeting regime, the monetary authority decides according to inflation prospects, 
analyzing alternative scenarios for the main variables that determine price dynamics and the balance of risks 
associated to the forecasts. Despite the remaining uncertainties regarding the US economy, the international 
scenario remains favorable, and benefits the external sector contribution for the maintenance of a benign 
inflationary outlook. On the other hand, a set of price pressures arises when domestic demand expands vigorously, 
backing-up the economic activity recovery. This expansion encompasses some sectors little exposed to external 
competition, when the effects of important incentive factors, such as the monetary easing already implemented, are 
not fully perceived. In such environment, the monetary authority must remain vigilant, so that short-term 
uncertainties do not contaminate longer time horizons.  
 
27. 
At the conclusion of the meeting, it was announced that the Copom would reconvene on July 17th 2007, for 
technical presentations, and on the following day to discuss the monetary policy decision, as established in 
Communiqué 15,011 of October 31, 2006. 
 
SUMMARY OF DATA ANALYZED BY THE COPOM 
 
Inflation 
 
28. 
The IPCA increased 0.28% in May, up from 0.25% in April, accumulating 3.18% growth in twelve months. 
In the year through May, the index increased 1.79%, above the 1.75% rise recorded in the same period of 2006. 
This rise in May reflected distinct behavior among the large groups. The main increases were for food and 
beverages, especially in natura milk; personal outlays, especially household workers; and clothing, as a result of 
seasonal pressures. In an opposite side, the lowest rates were for communication, housing, and transportation, due 
to the cooling of oil prices rises.   
 
6
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
29. 
Market prices inflation increased 0.25% in May, up from 0.19% in April, while regulated prices decreased 
totaled 0.35%, down from 0.39%, in the same period. In the last twelve months, market prices increased 3.32%, 
and regulated prices, 2.88%. Among market prices, the prices of non-tradable goods increased by 4.42%, mainly 
because of the 4.88% elevation in services prices, while the prices of tradable goods prices increased by 2.14%.  
 
30. 
On a twelve-month trailing basis, smoothed trimmed means core measure maintained a downward trend, 
while the core excluding household food and regulated prices and the non-smoothed trimmed means core 
recorded rises. Even recording rises under these two criteria, the cores changes stood below the target for the 
IPCA. The smoothed trimmed means core increased 0.30% in the month, up from 0.29% in April, totaling 3.68% in 
the twelve months through May, down from 3.85% in April. The non-smoothed trimmed means core reached 0.30% 
in May, up from 0.28% in April, accumulating 2.39% in twelve months, compared to 2.33% in April. Finally, the core 
excluding household food and regulated prices reached 0.33% in May, up from 0.29% in the previous month, and 
accumulated 3.04% in twelve months, compared to 2.66% in the previous month. 
 
31. 
The IGP-DI increased to 0.16% in May, up from 0.14% in April, accumulating 1.18% in the year through 
May and 4.38% in twelve months. Considering the main components of the index, the rate increase was, 
exclusively, a result of the INCC elevation, which reached 1.15% in the month, up from 0.46% in the previous 
month. The INCC result was mainly driven by the 1.81% increase in the cost of the workforce, due to wage 
readjustments in Brasília, Fortaleza, Florianópolis, Goiânia and São Paulo. The IPC-Br increased 0.25% in May, 
down from 0.31% in April, while the IPA-DI (Wholesale Prices Index) totaled –0.04% in May, down from 0.02% in 
the previous month.  
 
32. 
The lower IPA inflation in May reflected the continuous reduction of agricultural prices, despite at a lower 
pace, and the cooling of industrial prices. The Agricultural IPA totaled -1.94% in May, compared to -2.44% in April, 
while the Industrial IPA recorded 0.58% and 0.84% for the same period. The main negative drivers were legumes 
and fruit, sugar cane, poultry and eggs, among agricultural prices, and moisturized ethylic alcohol and sugar, 
among industrial prices. The main pressures in May stemmed from the prices of in natura milk, fuel oil, non-ferrous 
metals, iron, steel and steel by-products and fertilizers. The IPA-DI increased 0.61% and 4.76%, in the year 
through May and in twelve months, respectively. According to the processing stages of production, the prices of 
final goods declined 0.15%, after a 0.85% elevation in April, mainly mirroring the deceleration of fuel prices, which 
totaled -1.10% in May, compared to 2.76% in April. The prices of intermediate goods increased 1.01% in May, up 
from 0.96% in April, with highlights to the prices of manufacturing materials and components. The prices of raw 
materials recorded –1.89% in May, compared to –2.78% in the previous month.  
  
Economic Activity 
 
33. 
According to IBGE’s monthly survey, retail sales increased 1.1% in March, on a month-on-month 
seasonally adjusted basis. Among the activities composing the general index, only fuel and lubricants sales 
decreased (0.1% growth). The remaining segments expanded, with highlights to fabric, clothing and shoes (2.7% 
growth), and hyper- and super-markets, food products, beverages and tobacco (1.2% growth). Vehicles, 
motorcycles, parts and pieces, which does not compose the general retail sales index, increased 4.4% in the 
month. On a regional basis, 18 out of the 27 Brazilian states showed positive results in March, compared to 
February, seasonally adjusted, while all the units recorded rises in comparison to March 2006, with highlights to the 
increases recorded in the South and Mid-West, mirroring the effects of the income recovery in the agricultural 
sector.    
 
34. 
Compared to March 2006, retail sales grew 11.5%, driven by the increases in all segments, mainly furniture 
and domestic appliances (18.1%) and hypermarkets (9.3%). Expanded retail sales increased 13.2%, highlighting 
the sales of vehicles, motorcycles, parts and pieces (18.5%). 
 
35. 
Retail sales performance reflects the continuity of payroll growth and better credit conditions, together with 
the recovery of the crop and livestock sector.  Retail sales increase reached 9.7% in the first quarter of 2007; 
expanded retail sales, which include civil construction inputs and vehicles, motorcycles, parts and pieces, 
 
7
 
 
 
 
 
 
increased by 11.8%, under the same comparison basis. It bears emphasizing the performance of furniture and 
domestic appliances (20.5%) and vehicles (17.4%). 
   
36.  
São Paulo Trade Association (ACSP) data, related to the city of São Paulo and seasonally adjusted by the 
BCB, showed a 0.8% increase in database consultations for credit sales, and a 0.7% reduction in consultations to 
the Usecheque system in May, on a month-on-month basis.  In comparison to May 2006, there were increases of 
5.6% and 6.1%, respectively.  
   
37.  
Regarding investment indicators, civil construction inputs production expanded month-on-month 1.3% in 
April, while capital goods domestic production fell 1.2%, seasonally adjusted. Capital goods contraction should not 
be interpreted as a trend change, in view of the 15.4% and 8.5% expansions registered in the first four months of 
2007 and in the last twelve months, respectively. In the first four months of the year, capital goods production for 
mixed use increased by 17.0%; typically manufactured capital goods expanded by 17.7%, while capital goods 
production for energy and for civil construction grew 14.4% and 10.7%, respectively. Production of capital goods for 
agriculture expanded by 19.1% in the same period, while the negative twelve-month trailing production reduced to 
–4.3% in April, compared to -8.9% in March, confirming the upturn of the trend at the margin.

BNDES funding for medium- and long-term investment totaled R$14.9 billion in the first four months of 
2007, 39.8% above the amount disbursed in the same period of 2006. The recent acceleration of this indicator is 
also evident in the 21.9% expansion observed in the twelve months through April.     
 
39.  
Industrial production declined 0.1% in April, according to IBGE’s Monthly Industrial Survey (PIM) 
seasonally adjusted data. On a 3-month moving average basis, which attenuates punctual oscillations, industrial 
activity reached a record high for the thirteenth consecutive month, in April. Moreover, industrial production rose by 
6.0%, compared to April 2006, and expanded by 4.3% and 3.3%, in the first four months of 2007 and in the last 
twelve months, respectively.  
  
40.  
Considering seasonally adjusted data, mining production expanded by 0.3%, while manufacturing industry 
production remained stable. Regarding use categories, production of capital goods, intermediate goods and 
durable consumer goods reduced by 1.2%, 0.6% and 1.3%, respectively, while semi and non-durable goods 
production increased by 0.8%. Despite the reduction in April, capital goods production expanded by 15.4% in the 
year through April.     
 
41.  
Disaggregated data of seasonally adjusted industrial activity showed that 12 of the 23 sectors surveyed 
grew in April, with highlights to beverages (4.3%) and other chemical products (2.3%).  The main negative drivers 
were food (-1.9%), perfumes, soaps and cleaning products (-5.7%) and electronic materials and communication 
equipment (-3.4%).  
 
42.  
Still considering the industrial activity, according to CNI data, seasonally adjusted by the BCB, hours 
worked in production expanded by 1.0% and real industrial sales declined 1.2% in April, month-on-month. In the 
year through April, these indicators increased by 3.6% and 4.8%, respectively, compared to the same period of 
2006. After seasonal adjustment, installed capacity utilization stood at 81.9% in April, almost unchanged compared 
to the previous month (82.0%). Considering observed data, utilization level reached 81.7%, 3.2 p.p. above the April 
2006 figure.        
 
43.  
According to Anfavea, vehicles production reached 258.9 thousand units in May, a monthly record high, a 
7.2% increase relative to the same month of 2006. According to data seasonally adjusted by the BCB, vehicles 
production expanded by 3.0%, after a 1.7% reduction in April, on a month-on-month basis. Sales of overall 
automotive industry increased 13.3%, relative to May 2006, totaling 263.8 thousand units, a monthly record high. 
As exports reduced by 7.6%, such performance was exclusively due to the domestic absorption, which increased 
23.8% (also a record high for the series). Considering the month-on-month seasonally adjusted series, domestic 
sales increased by 4.7%, while exports expanded by 7.1%.  
        
44.   
According to the IBGE, the current estimate for the crops harvest in the 2006-7 period pointed to a 13.0% 
increase, compared to the previous harvest. National production of grains should reach 132.3 million tons, due to 
 
8
 
 
 
 
 
 
good weather conditions and the production incentive driven by the increase of international agricultural 
commodities prices. In April’s survey, the main forecast increases related to wheat (52.3%), cottonseed (30.1%), 
corn (20.6%), bean (10.2%) and soy (9.2%), while the main decreases related to coffee and rice production (15.3% 
and 4.1%, respectively). It still bears emphasizing the increase in land occupation for sugar cane production, driven 
by the growing interest in ethanol production. Sugar cane plantations increased by 8.9% in 2007, and the 
production should expand by 12.7%, year-on-year. 
 
Surveys and Expectations 
 
45. 
The Fecomercio-SP survey showed declines of 1% in the Consumer Confidence Index (ICC) in May, 
month-on-month, and 8.4%, compared to May 2006. The Current Economic Conditions Index (Icea) increased 
month-on-month 0.7% in May, while the Consumer Expectation Index (IEC) declined by 2.3%. In fact, the Icea 
remained above the IEC for the fifth consecutive month. 
 
46. 
According to the FGV survey, which encompasses two thousand homes in the seven main state capitals of 
the country, the ICC increased 2.6% month-on-month in May. This result is due to the improvement in both the 
assessment of the present situation and in the 6-month ahead expectations. Compared to May 2006, the ICC rose 
7.3%, mainly because of the 8.9% increase in the IEC.  
 
47. 
Still according to FGV, the Industry Confidence Index (ICI), which encompasses six items of the 
Manufacturing Industry Survey, declined 1.8% month-on-month in May, after the record high observed in April. The 
ICI rose 15.9% relative to May 2006, totaling an 8.1% expansion in the first four months of 2007, compared to the 
same period of 2006. This result is due to the positive assessments about the expected level of demand and the 
predictions of higher hiring in industry. The level of installed capacity utilization reached 84.8% in May, up from 
82.7% in May 2006. 
 
48. 
According to the Manufacturing Industry Survey, carried out by FGV in April 34% of the companies 
surveyed affirmed that their investment in fixed capital is higher in the first half of 2007 than that observed in the 
previous half, while 21% affirmed that their investment is lower. The prediction of higher investment in the second 
half of 2007 also reached 34% of the companies, while 14% of the companies intend to invest less. The main 
reasons to invest in fixed capital quoted by the firms were: the expansion of production capacity (47%), and the 
increase in production efficiency (31%). The high tax burden was the main factor for inhibiting investments in fixed 
assets, totaling 49% of the answers, 4 p.p. above the proportion registered last year. The cost of credit was quoted 
by 18% of the companies, the lower relative frequency of the historical series started in 1998.     
 
Labor Market 
 
49. 
According to the Ministry of Labor and Employment, 302 thousand new formal jobs were created in April, a 
record high for the month, since the beginning of the series in 1985. In the first four months of the year, 701.6 
thousand new jobs were created, 23.2% above the figure observed in the same period of 2006, driving employment 
expansion by 4.8%. In the last twelve months, expansion also reached 4.8%, with highlights to the 8.0% increase in 
civil construction employment and 5.7% in commerce employment. After seasonal adjustment, employment 
increased month-on-month 0.5% in April, with increases in all sectors.  
 
50. 
According to the IBGE employment survey (PME) in the six main metropolitan areas of the country, the 
unemployment rate stayed unchanged at 10.1% in April 2007. The unemployment rate stability reflects mainly the 
0.33% and 0.34% decreases in employed population and economically active population (PEA), respectively. The 
reduction of 68 thousand employed workers was due to reductions of 2.4% in the number of informal workers and 
3.0% in the number of civil and military servants and increase of 0.7% in the number of workers in the private 
sector. In the first four months of 2007, the average number of workers increased by 2.9%, relative to the same 
period of 2006, reflecting an expansion of investments and recovery of the agricultural sector. Among the workers 
in the private sector, the number of formal workers increased by 4.1%, while the number of informal workers 
remained stable, highlighting a qualitative improvement in the labor market.

51. 
According to the same survey, real average earnings reached R$1,114.00 in April, a 0.3% month-on-month 
increase and a 5% elevation compared to April 2006. Real payrolls decreased 0.1% month-on-month in April, 
reflecting the reduction in the number of formal workers, but maintained a yearly rising trend, with an 8.4% increase 
in April, compared to the same month last year, and 8.0% in 2007.     
 
External Environment 
 
52. 
The global economic environment remains favorable and with controlled risks. Recent data shows steady 
consumption in the US and slight acceleration of GDP growth in Europe and Asia. Despite the lower expansion 
(17% in 2006, compared to 34% in 2005), net private capital inflows for emerging markets reached a US$ 647 
billion record high.  
 
53. 
In the US, the revised GDP growth rate in the first quarter decreased to 0.6% from 1.3%, the lowest rate 
since the 0.2% rate reached in the last quarter of 2002. However, important aggregate demand components remain 
robust, and can sustain larger expansion throughout the year. The consumption expansion, whose weight in total 
demand exceeds 2/3, increases to 4.4%, up from 3.8%. Combined with a reduction in inventories, this acceleration 
makes room to an increase in production. In the housing sector, the sales of new real state properties increased 
month-on-month 16.2% in April, smoothing the depressing effects over the economy. These data confirm the 
Federal Reserve Bank (Fed) perception of moderate acceleration of growth in the next quarters. 
 
54. 
The confidence indices that measure consumers sentiment point to the same direction: the Conference 
Board rose to 108.0 in May, up from 106.3 in April, and the one from the Michigan University rose to 88.7, up from 
87.1. The confidence index of the manufacturing industry increased to 54.7 in April, up from 50.9 in March, and 
reached the highest level of the last months. Month-on-month industrial production rose 0.7% in April, above 
market expectations, and the installed capacity utilization increased to 81.6%, up from 81.2%. The recent behavior 
of inflation reduces the expectations of inflation pressures. The consumer price index (CPI) increased 2.6% in the 
last twelve months through April, and its core, 2.3%, at a lower pace than the observed in the previous month. The 
producer price index (PPI) increased 0.7% and its core remained unchanged. 
 
55. 
In the Euro zone, first quarter GDP grew 3.1%, relative to the same quarter of 2006, above market 
expectations. The German GDP also increased above expectations, 3.6% in the year and 0.5% in the quarter. The 
consumer confidence index reached 119.9 in May, up from 111 in April, the highest level observed since January 
2001. However, twelve-month trailing inflation through May remained stable at 1.9%, in line with the European 
Central Bank (ECB) target. In Japan, despite below the 2.7% market expectations, GDP grew by 2.4% p.a. in the 
first quarter, confirming the maintenance of the growth pace. 
 
56. 
In China, economy has continued to record robust expansion. Industrial production grew 17.4% in April, 
relative to April 2006, accumulating an 18% increase in 2007. Trade surplus reached US$16.9 billion in April, a 
144% increase over March, totaling US$63.3 billion in the first four months of 2007, an 88% increase over the 
same period of 2006. The strong pace of activity has reflected in inflation. The Consumer Price Index increased 3% 
in the twelve months through April, while the Wholesale Price Index reached 2.9%, under the same comparison 
basis, up from 2.7% in March. 
 
57. 
The Bank of England (BoE) raised its interest rate by 0.25 b.p., to 5.5% p.a., as a consequence of 
inflationary pressures, mainly stemming from services prices. The Consumer Price Index increased by 3.1% in the 
twelve months through March, exceeding the upper limit of the inflation target. However, with the 0.3% increase in 
April, the Consumer Price Index decreased to 2.8% in the twelve months through April. The Wholesale Price Index 
increased month-on-month 0.5% in April, down from 0.6% in March. On a twelve-month trailing basis, the index 
totaled 2.5% in April, down from 2.7% in March. 
 
58. 
At the end of May, the Chinese government tripled a stamp tax on securities transactions to 0.3%, to cool 
the growth in the stock markets. As a consequence, the Shangai composite share index fell by 6.5%, but spillovers 
for other international stock markets were limited. On May 31, the main European share index (FTEurofirst 300) 
reached a record high for the last six and a half years, boosted by mining and oil companies. Strong swings 
prevailed in FX markets, with devaluation of the US dollar.

Foreign Trade and International Reserves 
 
59. 
In the first five months of 2007, Brazilian foreign trade continued to expand. Trade surplus reached 
US$16.8 billion in the period, and US$47.9 billion in the twelve months through May, while total external trade 
totaled US$103.3 billion and US$248.8 billion, according to the same comparison bases. 
 
60. 
Exports reached US$13.6 billion in May, a record high for the month, with a daily average of US$620.4 
million, a 32.4% increase over May 2006. Manufactured goods external sales reached US$7.1 billion in the month, 
a 21.9% increase over May 2006, considering daily averages. Primary products exports totaled US$4.4 billion, and 
semi-manufactured ones, US$1.9 billion, with respective increases of 49.6% and 46.9%, according to the same 
comparison basis. In addition to shipment records, international prices of important export products continued to 
increase, with highlights to orange juice (80.4%); raw soybean oil (34.6%); poultry (34.1%); metal laminates 
(32.7%) and iron/steel semi-manufactured (31.9%). In the first five months of 2007, exports continued to show 
diversification in terms of products, particularly regarding manufactured items with low share in total exports, and 
expansion of exports destinations. 
 
61. 
Imports totaled US$9.8 billion in May, a record high for the month, a 34.2% increase over May 2006. All 
categories expanded: raw materials (38.6%); consumer goods (33.5%); capital goods (28.8%); and fuels and 
lubricants (28.5%), according to the same comparison basis. Among imports of raw materials, it bears emphasizing 
imports of food, transportation equipment parts, mining products, non-food farming, chemicals and pharmaceutical 
products. Among consumer goods imports, it bears emphasizing the imports of clothes, beverages and tobacco, 
vehicles, furniture, beauty products and pharmaceutical products. Amongst capital goods imports, one should 
highlight imports of industrial machinery, machines and equipment for office and scientific service, and parts and 
pieces for capital goods. 
 
Money Market and Open Market Operations 
 
62. 
After the April Copom meeting, the yield curve shifted downward, mainly driven by Brazilian positive 
economic indicators and by the revised Brazil’s sovereign ratings by two rating agencies. In light of an also 
favorable external environment, reflected in the persistent highs of the international stock markets, the positive FX 
flow allowed the appreciation of the real against the US dollar, contributing to a downward movement of domestic 
interest rates, mainly for the short term. In the last week of May, evaluations that Chinese stock markets were 
overheated led to profit realization in international stock markets, affecting the domestic interest rate market. 
Between April 16 and June 4, one-, two- and three-year rates reduced by 0.73 p.p., 0.90 p.p. and 0.95 p.p., 
respectively. One-, three- and six-month rates also declined 0.37 p.p., 0.44 p.p. and 0.60 p.p., respectively. The 
real interest rate measured by the differential between the one-year forward nominal interest rate and the smoothed 
twelve-month ahead inflation expectations fell to 7.31%, on June 4, down from 7.79%, on April 16  
 
63. 
Between April 17 and June 4, the BCB conducted 11 reverse exchange rate swap auctions, totaling US$11 
billion. 
 
64. 
In its open market operations, the BCB carried out, from April 17 to June 4, weekly five- and seven-month 
long fixed rate repo operations. The average daily balance of these operations amounted R$73.1 billion, of which 
R$56.1 billion were seven-month operations. In the same period, the BCB also conducted 28 overnight repo 
operations, of which 25 aimed at draining the excess liquidity from the market. In addition, in one repo operation 
aimed at draining the excess liquidity, the tenure totaled 32 working days. The BCB also conducted daily liquidity 
management operations with tenures up to two working days. Operations with tenors less than thirty days, 
including daily liquidity management operations, averaged R$14.6 billion, borrowing. 
 
65. 
Between April 17 and June 4, the National Treasury raised a total of R$76.9 billion, of which R$37.2 billion 
in fixed-rate securities: R$18.1 billion via issuance of LTNs maturing in 2008 and 2009 and R$19.2 billion in NTN-
Fs maturing in 2010, 2012 and 2017. Issuance of LFTs totaled R$13 billion, for securities maturing in 2010 and 
2012. Issuance of inflation-linked NTN-Bs reached R$26.7 billion, for securities maturing in 2009, 2011, 2012, 
2015, 2017, 2024, 2035 and 2045, of which R$13.1 billion were settled via delivery of other securities. 
 
 
11
 
 
 
 
 
 
66. 
In the same period, the Treasury conducted auctions to sell LTNs maturing in April, July and October 2008 
conjugated to the purchase of shorter-term LTNs, totaling R$9.0 billion. The Treasury also conducted auctions to 
sell LFTs maturing in 2010 and 2012, totaling R$4.5 billion, accepting as payment LFTs maturing in 2007. 
Moreover, the Treasury conducted auctions to buy LTNs maturing in July 2007, totaling R$5.9 billion and NTN-Bs 
totaling US$246 million.
