      "A) Update of economic outlook and Copom’s scenario1 \n",
      "1. The global environment remains adverse and volatile, marked by prospects of below-\n",
      "potential 2023 global growth. The tightening of financial conditions in major \n",
      "economies, difficulties in energy supply to Europe, and a challenging scenario for \n",
      "growth in China, partly due to the Covid-19 policy in the country, reinforce a slowing \n",
      "global growth outlook in the coming quarters. \n",
      "2. The inflationary environment remains challenging. There is a normalization in supply \n",
      "chains and an accommodation in the prices of major commodities in the recent period, \n",
      "which should lead to a moderation in global goods-related inflationary pressures. In \n",
      "turn, the low level of labor market slack in some economies, coupled with high current \n",
      "inflation and a high degree of diffusion, suggests that inflationary pressures on the \n",
      "services sector should last longer. \n",
      "3. The process of normalization of monetary policy in advanced economies continues \n",
      "towards contractionary rates synchronized across countries, tightening financial \n",
      "conditions, impacting economic growth expectations, and raising the risk of abrupt \n",
      "repricing movements in the markets. The Committee noted a stronger market \n",
      "sensitivity of financial assets to fiscal fundamentals, including in advanced economies, \n",
      "and lower liquidity in several markets. This environment calls for greater caution in the \n",
      "conduct of economic policies also by emerging economies.  \n",
      "4. Turning to the Brazilian economy, the set of indicators released since the previous \n",
      "meeting corroborates the scenario of slowdown in the growth expected by the \n",
      "Committee. The release of the third quarter GDP figures suggested a more moderate \n",
      "growth rate than in previous quarters, despite expansion in all components of demand. \n",
      "Similarly, the labor market continues to recover, but at a slower pace than in previous \n",
      "months. \n",
      "5. Despite the recent reduction, especially on items which are more volatile and \n",
      "affected by tax measures, consumer inflation remains high. Items related to industrial \n",
      "goods, reflecting the more intense decrease in producer prices and the reduction of \n",
      "pressures in global value chains, also showed deceleration, albeit still slow. The inflation \n",
      "of the components more sensitive to the economic cycle and the monetary policy, \n",
      "which present greater inflationary inertia, remain above the range compatible with \n",
      "meeting the inflation target, albeit showing some marginal moderation. Inflation \n",
      "expectations for 2022, 2023, and 2024 collected by the Focus survey are around 5.9%, \n",
      "5.1%, and 3.5%, respectively. \n",
      " \n",
      "B) Scenarios and risk analysis  \n",
      "6. In the reference scenario, the interest rate path is extracted from the Focus survey, \n",
      "and the exchange rate starts at USD/BRL 5.252 and evolves according to the purchasing \n",
      "power parity (PPP). The Committee assumes that oil prices follow approximately the \n",
      "futures market curve for the following six months and then start increasing 2% per year \n",
      "onwards. Moreover, the energy flag is assumed to be “green” in December 2022 and \n",
      "“yellow” in December 2023 and 2024. In this scenario, Copom’s inflation projections \n",
      "stand at 6.0% for 2022, 5.0% for 2023, and 3.0% for 2024. Inflation projections for \n",
      "administered prices are -3.6% for 2022, 9.1% for 2023, and 4.2% for 2024. The \n",
      "Committee decided again to emphasize the six-quarter-ahead horizon, which reflects \n",
      "the relevant horizon, mitigates the primary effects from the tax changes but \n",
      "incorporates their second-round effects. On this horizon, which refers to the second \n",
      "quarter of 2024, the 12-month inflation projection stands at 3.3%. The Committee \n",
      " \n",
      "1 Unless explicitly stated otherwise, this update considers changes that occurred since the October Copom \n",
      "meeting (250th meeting). \n",
      "2 Value obtained according to the usual procedure of rounding the average USD/BRL exchange rate observed \n",
      "on the five business days ending on the last day of the week before the Copom meeting. \n",

      "bcb.gov.br \n",
      "judges that the uncertainty in its assumptions and projections is higher than usual. \n",
      "7. The Committee discussed the speed of the global disinflation process. On the one \n",
      "hand, the relaxation of pressures on global production chains, as well as the recent drop \n",
      "in commodity prices, indicate that the movement should continue in the short term, \n",
      "especially in the industrial goods, energy, and food segments. On the other hand, the \n",
      "Committee discussed that, given the spread of inflationary pressures to the services \n",
      "segment, which has a more inertial nature, in an environment of tight labor markets in \n",
      "several countries, the disinflation process should be non-linear and slower than that \n",
      "observed in recent episodes.  \n",
      "8. Thus, the Committee continues to assess that the commitment and determination of \n",
      "central banks to reduce inflationary pressures and anchor expectations consolidate a \n",
      "global scenario of longer tightening of financial conditions, with interest rates at the \n",
      "end of the tightening cycle maintained for a sufficiently long period at contractionary \n",
      "levels, raising the risk of a more pronounced global deceleration. \n",
      "9. The Committee discussed two recent facts while analyzing the international \n",
      "markets. Firstly, it continues to assess that markets are more sensitive to developments \n",
      "that affect fiscal fundamentals, due to the combination of higher interest rates and \n",
      "sovereign debt at historically high levels. In addition, the Committee discussed the \n",
      "lower liquidity present in sovereign bond markets, possibly due to greater uncertainty \n",
      "in the interest rate dynamics, the reversal of long-term asset purchase policies and \n",
      "regulatory changes. These issues require monitoring and may also impact assets from \n",
      "emerging economies more strongly. \n",
      "10. Data on economic activity in Brazil continues to indicate a more moderate pace of \n",
      "marginal growth. The release of the third quarter GDP figures indicates a reduction in \n",
      "the pace of growth, especially in some of the more cyclical components. Nevertheless, \n",
      "growth was observed in all demand components and, in the supply side, growth in \n",
      "industry and services. Moreover, labor market data also indicate a reduction in the pace \n",
      "of job openings, but still with positive marginal net hirings. The set of released data, \n",
      "including the drop in confidence indicators and the reduction in credit granting, \n",
      "together with the lagged effects of monetary policy, reinforce the Committee's \n",
      "expectation of a slowdown in the pace of economic activity, which should worsen over \n",
      "the coming quarters. \n",
      "11. The inflationary outlook was then discussed, based on the more recent information. \n",
      "Some members noted the benign movement of commodities in BRL, highlighting \n",
      "additional downside risks ahead. Other members emphasized the volatile nature of \n",
      "these prices in an environment of pressured inventories. Finally, all members evaluated \n",
      "that current inflation did not surprise significantly in relation to expectations or \n",
      "substantially changed the understanding about future inflation dynamics. Moreover, \n",
      "they emphasized that disinflation in services and core inflation – components with \n",
      "greater inertia – will require increased attention and perseverance in the conduct of \n",
      "monetary policy. \n",
      "12. The Committee discussed extensively the impacts of different fiscal scenarios on \n",
      "inflation. In its analysis, the Committee reiterated the different channels through which \n",
      "fiscal policy can affect inflation not only via the primary effects of aggregated demand \n",
      "but also via asset prices, the degree of economic uncertainty, inflation expectations, \n",
      "and neutral interest rate. The Committee evaluated that changes in parafiscal policies \n",
      "or the reversal of structural reforms that lead to a less efficient allocation of resources \n",
      "might reduce the power of monetary policy. In the different exercises analyzed, it was \n",
      "evaluated that the final effect, either on inflation or on activity, will depend on both the \n",
      "combination and the magnitude of the fiscal and parafiscal policies. Furthermore, it was \n",
      "highlighted that the existence of economic slack and the confidence in the debt \n",
      "sustainability are determining factors for an expansionary fiscal policy to achieve the \n",
      "aimed impacts on the economic activity. In an environment of a narrow output gap, the \n",

      "impacts on economic activity.  \n",
      "13. The Committee believes that there is still a lot of uncertainty about the prospective \n",
      "fiscal scenario and that the moment requires caution in risk assessment. The Committee \n",
      "reiterates that it will continue to monitor future fiscal policy developments and their \n",
      "potential impacts on prospective inflation dynamics.  \n",
      "14. It emphasizes that risks to its scenarios remain in both directions. Among the upside \n",
      "risks for the inflationary scenario and inflation expectations, it should be emphasized (i) \n",
      "a greater persistence of global inflationary pressures; (ii) the heightened uncertainty \n",
      "about the country's future fiscal framework and additional fiscal stimuli that support \n",
      "aggregate demand, partially incorporated in inflation expectations and asset prices; and \n",
      "(iii) an output gap tighter than the one currently adopted by the Committee in its \n",
      "reference scenario, especially in the labor market. Among the downside risks, it should \n",
      "be noted (i) an additional reduction in the prices of international commodities \n",
      "measured in local currency; (ii) a greater-than-projected deceleration of global \n",
      "economic activity; and (iii) the continuity of tax cuts assumed to be reversed in 2023. \n",
      "The current scenario, particularly uncertain on the fiscal side, requires serenity when \n",
      "evaluating risks. The Committee will closely monitor future developments in fiscal \n",
      "policy and, in particular, its effects on asset prices and inflation expectations, with \n",
      "potential impacts on the dynamics of future inflation. \n",
      " \n",
      "C) Discussion about the conduct of monetary policy \n",
      "15. Copom discussed the conduct of monetary policy, considering the set of projections \n",
      "evaluated, as well as the balance of risks for inflation. \n",
      "16. The 12-month inflation projection for the second quarter of 2024, in the scenario \n",
      "using the interest rate trajectory extracted from the Focus Survey, remains consistent \n",
      "with the strategy of inflation convergence to around the target over the relevant \n",
      "horizon. The Committee decided again to emphasize the six-quarter-ahead horizon for \n",
      "its projections, and stresses that this decision is conditional on the temporary nature of \n",
      "the taxes. Moreover, the Committee continues to consider that inflation projection for \n",
      "2024 is also around the target. This assessment reflects the lower-than-normal visibility \n",
      "of the forward-looking scenario, which increases the uncertainty of the point \n",
      "projections communicated by the Committee over longer horizons.  \n",
      "17. Copom anticipates that, if the alternative scenario of maintaining tax exemption on \n",
      "fuels in 2023 materializes, it will again emphasize usual horizons that include the first \n",
      "quarter of 2023. However, it assesses that there will be no relevant impacts on the \n",
      "conduct of monetary policy since the primary effects of such measures are already \n",
      "being disregarded. \n",
      "18. Copom began by discussing the evolution of the broad array of data monitored, the \n",
      "projections, inflation expectations, output gap, and the balance of risks. Copom's \n",
      "inflation projections showed a slight increase over the relevant horizon due to both an \n",
      "increase in the projection for the inflation of market prices in shorter terms and a \n",
      "revision of the projection for the inflation of administered prices over longer terms. \n",
      "Compared to the previous meeting, the median inflation expectations from the Focus \n",
      "Survey rose slightly for 2023 and remained stable for 2024. However, regarding 2024, \n",
      "the Committee noted with concern a rise in the average expectations. The uncertainty \n",
      "about future fiscal dynamics, and its consequences on inflation dynamics, was \n",
      "discussed, and the uncertain environment was deemed to require serenity in assessing \n",
      "these risks. Services inflation showed some moderation but remains at high levels, and \n",
      "the Committee believes that the disinflation process of this component will become \n",
      "clearer over time. Finally, regarding the output gap, the Committee observed a \n",
      "reduction in the degree of economic slack in the third quarter, due to data revisions and \n",

      "time, the cumulative impacts to be observed of the intense and timely monetary policy \n",

      "data released, projections, inflation expectations, the balance of risks, and the lags of \n",
      "the effects of the monetary policy already in significantly contractionary territory, it was \n",
      "appropriate to maintain the interest rate at the level of 13.75% p.a. The Committee \n",
      "reinforced that it is necessary to remain vigilant, assessing if the strategy of maintaining \n",
      "the Selic rate for a sufficiently long period will be enough to ensure the convergence of \n",
      "inflation. \n",
      "20. The Committee emphasizes that it will persist until the disinflationary process \n",

      "available information, the Copom decided to maintain the Selic rate at 13.75% p.a. The \n",
      "Committee judges that this decision reflects the uncertainty around its scenarios for \n",
      "prospective inflation, an even higher-than-usual variance in the balance of risks, and is \n",
      "consistent with the strategy for inflation convergence to a level around its target \n",
      "throughout the relevant horizon for monetary policy, which includes 2023 and 2024. \n",
      "Without compromising its fundamental objective of ensuring price stability, this \n",
      "decision also implies smoothing of economic fluctuations and fosters full employment. \n",
      "22. The Committee will remain vigilant, assessing if the strategy of maintaining the Selic \n",
      "rate for a sufficiently long period will be enough to ensure the convergence of inflation. \n",
      "The Committee emphasizes that it will persist until the disinflationary process \n",
      "consolidates and inflation expectations anchor around its targets. The Committee \n",
      "reinforces that future monetary policy steps can be adjusted and will not hesitate to \n",

      "A) Update of economic outlook and Copom’s scenario1 \n",
      "1. The global environment remains adverse and volatile, marked by prospects of below-\n",
      "potential 2023 global growth. The tightening of financial conditions in major \n",
      "economies, difficulties in energy supply to Europe, and a challenging scenario for \n",
      "growth in China, partly due to the Covid-19 policy in the country, reinforce a slowing \n",
      "global growth outlook in the coming quarters. \n",
      "2. The inflationary environment remains challenging. There is a normalization in supply \n",
      "chains and an accommodation in the prices of major commodities in the recent period, \n",
      "which should lead to a moderation in global goods-related inflationary pressures. In \n",
      "turn, the low level of labor market slack in some economies, coupled with high current \n",
      "inflation and a high degree of diffusion, suggests that inflationary pressures on the \n",
      "services sector should last longer. \n",
      "3. The process of normalization of monetary policy in advanced economies continues \n",
      "towards contractionary rates synchronized across countries, tightening financial \n",
      "conditions, impacting economic growth expectations, and raising the risk of abrupt \n",
      "repricing movements in the markets. The Committee noted a stronger market \n",
      "sensitivity of financial assets to fiscal fundamentals, including in advanced economies, \n",
      "and lower liquidity in several markets. This environment calls for greater caution in the \n",
      "conduct of economic policies also by emerging economies.  \n",
      "4. Turning to the Brazilian economy, the set of indicators released since the previous \n",
      "meeting corroborates the scenario of slowdown in the growth expected by the \n",
      "Committee. The release of the third quarter GDP figures suggested a more moderate \n",
      "growth rate than in previous quarters, despite expansion in all components of demand. \n",
      "Similarly, the labor market continues to recover, but at a slower pace than in previous \n",
      "months. \n",
      "5. Despite the recent reduction, especially on items which are more volatile and \n",
      "affected by tax measures, consumer inflation remains high. Items related to industrial \n",
      "goods, reflecting the more intense decrease in producer prices and the reduction of \n",
      "pressures in global value chains, also showed deceleration, albeit still slow. The inflation \n",
      "of the components more sensitive to the economic cycle and the monetary policy, \n",
      "which present greater inflationary inertia, remain above the range compatible with \n",
      "meeting the inflation target, albeit showing some marginal moderation. Inflation \n",
      "expectations for 2022, 2023, and 2024 collected by the Focus survey are around 5.9%, \n",
      "5.1%, and 3.5%, respectively. \n",
      " \n",
      "B) Scenarios and risk analysis  \n",
      "6. In the reference scenario, the interest rate path is extracted from the Focus survey, \n",
      "and the exchange rate starts at USD/BRL 5.252 and evolves according to the purchasing \n",
      "power parity (PPP). The Committee assumes that oil prices follow approximately the \n",
      "futures market curve for the following six months and then start increasing 2% per year \n",
      "onwards. Moreover, the energy flag is assumed to be “green” in December 2022 and \n",
      "“yellow” in December 2023 and 2024. In this scenario, Copom’s inflation projections \n",
      "stand at 6.0% for 2022, 5.0% for 2023, and 3.0% for 2024. Inflation projections for \n",
      "administered prices are -3.6% for 2022, 9.1% for 2023, and 4.2% for 2024. The \n",
      "Committee decided again to emphasize the six-quarter-ahead horizon, which reflects \n",
      "the relevant horizon, mitigates the primary effects from the tax changes but \n",
      "incorporates their second-round effects. On this horizon, which refers to the second \n",
      "quarter of 2024, the 12-month inflation projection stands at 3.3%. The Committee \n",
      " \n",
      "1 Unless explicitly stated otherwise, this update considers changes that occurred since the October Copom \n",
      "meeting (250th meeting). \n",
      "2 Value obtained according to the usual procedure of rounding the average USD/BRL exchange rate observed \n",
      "on the five business days ending on the last day of the week before the Copom meeting. \n",

      "judges that the uncertainty in its assumptions and projections is higher than usual. \n",
      "7. The Committee discussed the speed of the global disinflation process. On the one \n",
      "hand, the relaxation of pressures on global production chains, as well as the recent drop \n",
      "in commodity prices, indicate that the movement should continue in the short term, \n",
      "especially in the industrial goods, energy, and food segments. On the other hand, the \n",
      "Committee discussed that, given the spread of inflationary pressures to the services \n",
      "segment, which has a more inertial nature, in an environment of tight labor markets in \n",
      "several countries, the disinflation process should be non-linear and slower than that \n",
      "observed in recent episodes.  \n",
      "8. Thus, the Committee continues to assess that the commitment and determination of \n",
      "central banks to reduce inflationary pressures and anchor expectations consolidate a \n",
      "global scenario of longer tightening of financial conditions, with interest rates at the \n",
      "end of the tightening cycle maintained for a sufficiently long period at contractionary \n",
      "levels, raising the risk of a more pronounced global deceleration. \n",
      "9. The Committee discussed two recent facts while analyzing the international \n",
      "markets. Firstly, it continues to assess that markets are more sensitive to developments \n",
      "that affect fiscal fundamentals, due to the combination of higher interest rates and \n",
      "sovereign debt at historically high levels. In addition, the Committee discussed the \n",
      "lower liquidity present in sovereign bond markets, possibly due to greater uncertainty \n",
      "in the interest rate dynamics, the reversal of long-term asset purchase policies and \n",
      "regulatory changes. These issues require monitoring and may also impact assets from \n",
      "emerging economies more strongly. \n",
      "10. Data on economic activity in Brazil continues to indicate a more moderate pace of \n",
      "marginal growth. The release of the third quarter GDP figures indicates a reduction in \n",
      "the pace of growth, especially in some of the more cyclical components. Nevertheless, \n",
      "growth was observed in all demand components and, in the supply side, growth in \n",
      "industry and services. Moreover, labor market data also indicate a reduction in the pace \n",
      "of job openings, but still with positive marginal net hirings. The set of released data, \n",
      "including the drop in confidence indicators and the reduction in credit granting, \n",
      "together with the lagged effects of monetary policy, reinforce the Committee's \n",
      "expectation of a slowdown in the pace of economic activity, which should worsen over \n",
      "the coming quarters. \n",
      "11. The inflationary outlook was then discussed, based on the more recent information. \n",
      "Some members noted the benign movement of commodities in BRL, highlighting \n",
      "additional downside risks ahead. Other members emphasized the volatile nature of \n",
      "these prices in an environment of pressured inventories. Finally, all members evaluated \n",
      "that current inflation did not surprise significantly in relation to expectations or \n",
      "substantially changed the understanding about future inflation dynamics. Moreover, \n",
      "they emphasized that disinflation in services and core inflation – components with \n",
      "greater inertia – will require increased attention and perseverance in the conduct of \n",
      "monetary policy. \n",
      "12. The Committee discussed extensively the impacts of different fiscal scenarios on \n",
      "inflation. In its analysis, the Committee reiterated the different channels through which \n",
      "fiscal policy can affect inflation not only via the primary effects of aggregated demand \n",
      "but also via asset prices, the degree of economic uncertainty, inflation expectations, \n",
      "and neutral interest rate. The Committee evaluated that changes in parafiscal policies \n",
      "or the reversal of structural reforms that lead to a less efficient allocation of resources \n",
      "might reduce the power of monetary policy. In the different exercises analyzed, it was \n",
      "evaluated that the final effect, either on inflation or on activity, will depend on both the \n",
      "combination and the magnitude of the fiscal and parafiscal policies. Furthermore, it was \n",
      "highlighted that the existence of economic slack and the confidence in the debt \n",
      "sustainability are determining factors for an expansionary fiscal policy to achieve the \n",
      "aimed impacts on the economic activity. In an environment of a narrow output gap, the \n",

      "fiscal scenario and that the moment requires caution in risk assessment. The Committee \n",
      "reiterates that it will continue to monitor future fiscal policy developments and their \n",
      "potential impacts on prospective inflation dynamics.  \n",
      "14. It emphasizes that risks to its scenarios remain in both directions. Among the upside \n",
      "risks for the inflationary scenario and inflation expectations, it should be emphasized (i) \n",
      "a greater persistence of global inflationary pressures; (ii) the heightened uncertainty \n",
      "about the country's future fiscal framework and additional fiscal stimuli that support \n",
      "aggregate demand, partially incorporated in inflation expectations and asset prices; and \n",
      "(iii) an output gap tighter than the one currently adopted by the Committee in its \n",
      "reference scenario, especially in the labor market. Among the downside risks, it should \n",
      "be noted (i) an additional reduction in the prices of international commodities \n",
      "measured in local currency; (ii) a greater-than-projected deceleration of global \n",
      "economic activity; and (iii) the continuity of tax cuts assumed to be reversed in 2023. \n",
      "The current scenario, particularly uncertain on the fiscal side, requires serenity when \n",
      "evaluating risks. The Committee will closely monitor future developments in fiscal \n",
      "policy and, in particular, its effects on asset prices and inflation expectations, with \n",
      "potential impacts on the dynamics of future inflation. \n",
      " \n",
      "C) Discussion about the conduct of monetary policy \n",
      "15. Copom discussed the conduct of monetary policy, considering the set of projections \n",
      "evaluated, as well as the balance of risks for inflation. \n",
      "16. The 12-month inflation projection for the second quarter of 2024, in the scenario \n",
      "using the interest rate trajectory extracted from the Focus Survey, remains consistent \n",
      "with the strategy of inflation convergence to around the target over the relevant \n",
      "horizon. The Committee decided again to emphasize the six-quarter-ahead horizon for \n",
      "its projections, and stresses that this decision is conditional on the temporary nature of \n",
      "the taxes. Moreover, the Committee continues to consider that inflation projection for \n",
      "2024 is also around the target. This assessment reflects the lower-than-normal visibility \n",
      "of the forward-looking scenario, which increases the uncertainty of the point \n",
      "projections communicated by the Committee over longer horizons.  \n",
      "17. Copom anticipates that, if the alternative scenario of maintaining tax exemption on \n",
      "fuels in 2023 materializes, it will again emphasize usual horizons that include the first \n",
      "quarter of 2023. However, it assesses that there will be no relevant impacts on the \n",
      "conduct of monetary policy since the primary effects of such measures are already \n",
      "being disregarded. \n",
      "18. Copom began by discussing the evolution of the broad array of data monitored, the \n",
      "projections, inflation expectations, output gap, and the balance of risks. Copom's \n",
      "inflation projections showed a slight increase over the relevant horizon due to both an \n",
      "increase in the projection for the inflation of market prices in shorter terms and a \n",
      "revision of the projection for the inflation of administered prices over longer terms. \n",
      "Compared to the previous meeting, the median inflation expectations from the Focus \n",
      "Survey rose slightly for 2023 and remained stable for 2024. However, regarding 2024, \n",
      "the Committee noted with concern a rise in the average expectations. The uncertainty \n",
      "about future fiscal dynamics, and its consequences on inflation dynamics, was \n",
      "discussed, and the uncertain environment was deemed to require serenity in assessing \n",
      "these risks. Services inflation showed some moderation but remains at high levels, and \n",
      "the Committee believes that the disinflation process of this component will become \n",
      "clearer over time. Finally, regarding the output gap, the Committee observed a \n",
      "reduction in the degree of economic slack in the third quarter, due to data revisions and \n",

      "Committee judges that this decision reflects the uncertainty around its scenarios for \n",
      "prospective inflation, an even higher-than-usual variance in the balance of risks, and is \n",
      "consistent with the strategy for inflation convergence to a level around its target \n",
      "throughout the relevant horizon for monetary policy, which includes 2023 and 2024. \n",
      "Without compromising its fundamental objective of ensuring price stability, this \n",
      "decision also implies smoothing of economic fluctuations and fosters full employment. \n",
